## Continuous integration

Your project is now configured with automatic deployments which occur whenever you push to the configured branch of your GitHub repository.

## Testing your application

After a successful deployment you can test your agents and workflows from the [Playground](/mastra-cloud/dashboard#playground) in Mastra Cloud, or interact with them using our [Client SDK](/client-js/overview).
