# Continuously Relevant Information

While [conversation history](./getting-started.mdx#conversation-history-last-messages) and [semantic recall](./semantic-recall.mdx) help agents remember conversations, working memory allows them to maintain persistent information about users across interactions within a thread.

Think of it as the agent's active thoughts or scratchpad â€“ the key information they keep available about the user or task. It's similar to how a person would naturally remember someone's name, preferences, or important details during a conversation.

This is useful for maintaining ongoing state that's always relevant and should always be available to the agent.

## Quick Start

Here's a minimal example of setting up an agent with working memory:

```typescript {12-15}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

// Create agent with working memory enabled
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "PersonalAssistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful personal assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      workingMemory: {
        enabled: true,
        use: "tool-call", // Recommended setting
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

## How it Works

Working memory is a block of Markdown text that the agent is able to update over time to store continuously relevant information:

1. The agent receives a template defining which information to track.
2. The working memory text is injected into the agents system instruction.
3. During conversations, the agent makes working memory updates using tool calls.
4. Every new interaction contains the single up to date copy of working memory containing updates made by the agent.

## Memory Templates

Templates guide the agent on what information to track and update in working memory. While a default template is used if none is provided, you'll typically want to define a custom template tailored to your agent's specific use case to ensure it remembers the most relevant information.

Here's an example of a custom template:

```typescript {5-28}
const memory = new Memory({
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      template: `
# User Profile
 
## Personal Info
 
- Name:
- Location:
- Timezone:
 
## Preferences
 
- Communication Style: [e.g., Formal, Casual]
- Project Goal:
- Key Deadlines:
  - [Deadline 1]: [Date]
  - [Deadline 2]: [Date]
 
## Session State
 
- Last Task Discussed:
- Open Questions:
  - [Question 1]
  - [Question 2]
`,
    },
  },
});
```

If your agent is not properly updating working memory when you expect it to, you can add system instructions on _how_ and _when_ to use this template in your agents `instruction` setting.

## Update Modes

Working memory supports two update modes:

1.  **Text Stream Mode** (`text-stream`):

    - **How it works**: The agent includes working memory updates directly in its response stream using special markdown tags (e.g., `<working_memory>...</working_memory>`). Mastra extracts this content and updates the memory.
    - **Pros**: Simpler concept, might work well for basic updates.
    - **Cons**: Less reliable with some models, requires masking tags in the UI, not compatible with `toDataStream()`.
    - **Configuration**:
      ```typescript
      const memory = new Memory({
        options: {
          workingMemory: {
            enabled: true,
            use: "text-stream", // Current default, but will be deprecated
          },
        },
      });
      ```

2.  **Tool Call Mode** (`tool-call`):
    - **How it works**: The agent uses a dedicated internal tool (`updateWorkingMemory`) to explicitly update the working memory content.
    - **Pros**: More structured, compatible with `toDataStream()`, suitable for agents skilled with tools, recommended.
    - **Cons**: Slightly more complex interaction flow (involves tool calls).
    - **Configuration**:
      ```typescript
      const memory = new Memory({
        options: {
          workingMemory: {
            enabled: true,
            use: "tool-call", // Recommended as it will become the default in future
          },
        },
      });
      ```

**Recommendation**: Use `tool-call` mode for better reliability and compatibility, especially with streaming UIs. `text-stream` mode will eventually be deprecated.

## Related Features

Working memory integrates with other memory features:

- **[Memory Processors](./memory-processors.mdx)**: Use `TokenLimiter` to manage token usage including working memory content.
- **[Conversation History](./getting-started.mdx#conversation-history-last-messages)**: Provides recent messages (covered in Getting Started).
- **[Semantic Recall](./semantic-recall.mdx)**: Finds relevant past information based on meaning.
