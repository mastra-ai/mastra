# voice.on()

The `on()` method registers event listeners for various voice events. This is particularly important for real-time voice providers, where events are used to communicate transcribed text, audio responses, and other state changes.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";
import chalk from "chalk";

const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,  // Audio sample rate in Hz - standard for high-quality audio on MacBook Pro
  channels: 1,        // Mono audio output (as opposed to stereo which would be 2)
  bitDepth: 16,       // Bit depth for audio quality - CD quality standard (16-bit resolution)
});

// Initialize a real-time voice provider
const voice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice({
  realtimeConfig: {
    model: "gpt-4o-mini-realtime",
    apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY,
  },
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// Register event listener for transcribed text
voice.on("writing", ({ text, role }) => {
  if (ev.role === 'user') {
    process.stdout.write(chalk.green(ev.text));
  } else {
    process.stdout.write(chalk.blue(ev.text));
  }
});

// Register event listener for speaker responses
voice.on("speaking", (stream) => {
  // Stream the audio to node speaker
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});

// Register event listener for errors
voice.on("error", ({ message, code, details }) => {
  console.error(`Error ${code}: ${message}`, details);
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "event",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of the event to listen for (e.g., 'speaking', 'writing', 'error')",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "callback",
      type: "function",
      description: "Callback function that will be called when the event occurs",
      isOptional: false,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Return Value

This method does not return a value.

## Standard Events

All voice providers that implement event handling support these standard events:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "speaking",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when audio data is available. The callback receives { audio } where audio is typically an Int16Array or Buffer.",
    },
    {
      name: "speaker",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when a new audio response is ready to be streamed. The callback receives a buffer that can be piped into node-speaker."
    },
    {
      name: "writing",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when text is transcribed or generated. The callback receives { text, role } where role is either 'user' or 'assistant'.",
    },
    {
      name: "error",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when an error occurs. The callback receives { message, code, details } with information about the error.",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Provider-Specific Events

Different voice providers may emit additional events specific to their implementation:

### OpenAI Realtime

OpenAI Realtime events are prefixed with `openAIRealtime:` and include:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "openAIRealtime:conversation.created",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when a new conversation is created.",
    },
    {
      name: "openAIRealtime:conversation.interrupted",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when a conversation is interrupted.",
    },
    {
      name: "openAIRealtime:conversation.updated",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when a conversation is updated.",
    },
    {
      name: "openAIRealtime:conversation.item.appended",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when an item is appended to the conversation.",
    },
    {
      name: "openAIRealtime:conversation.item.completed",
      type: "event",
      description: "Emitted when an item in the conversation is completed.",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Using with CompositeVoice

When using `CompositeVoice`, the `on()` method delegates to the configured real-time provider:

```typescript
import { CompositeVoice } from "@mastra/core/voice";
import { OpenAIRealtimeVoice } from "@mastra/voice-openai-realtime";
import Speaker from "@mastra/node-speaker";

const speaker = new Speaker({
  sampleRate: 24100,  // Audio sample rate in Hz - standard for high-quality audio on MacBook Pro
  channels: 1,        // Mono audio output (as opposed to stereo which would be 2)
  bitDepth: 16,       // Bit depth for audio quality - CD quality standard (16-bit resolution)
});

const realtimeVoice = new OpenAIRealtimeVoice();
const voice = new CompositeVoice({
  realtimeProvider: realtimeVoice,
});

// Connect to the real-time service
await voice.connect();

// This will register the event listener with the OpenAIRealtimeVoice provider
voice.on("speaker", (stream) => {
  stream.pipe(speaker)
});
```

## Notes

- This method is primarily used with real-time voice providers that support event-based communication
- If called on a voice provider that doesn't support events, it will log a warning and do nothing
- Event listeners should be registered before calling methods that might emit events
- To remove an event listener, use the `off()` method with the same event name and callback function
- Multiple listeners can be registered for the same event
- The callback function will receive different data depending on the event type
- For best performance, consider removing event listeners when they are no longer needed

## Related Methods

- [voice.off()](./voice.off) - Removes an event listener
- [voice.connect()](./voice.connect) - Establishes a connection to the real-time service
- [voice.send()](./voice.send) - Sends audio data to the voice provider
- [voice.answer()](./voice.answer) - Triggers the voice provider to respond
