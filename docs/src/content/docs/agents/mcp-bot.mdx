# Discord MCP Bot

The Discord MCP bot answers questions about Mastra.ai through Discord. It uses [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](/docs/agents/02a-mcp-guide) to:
- Find relevant documentation in the Mastra.ai docs
- Share code from the examples repository
- Answer questions about Mastra features and concepts

## Features

- Direct message support for private conversations
- Thread-based discussions in channels
- Documentation lookup through MCP docs server
- Code examples from the Mastra repository

## Using the Bot

### Commands

The bot uses Discord slash commands - type `/` to see available commands. The bot supports:

1. `/ask` - Ask questions about Mastra.ai
2. `/cleardm` - Clear bot messages in direct messages

### Usage

The bot works in both DMs and channels:

**Direct Messages**
- For private 1:1 conversations with the bot
- Use `/cleardm` to remove bot messages

**Server Channels**
- For team discussions and shared questions
- Creates a new thread for each `/ask` command

### Example Usage

Type `/ask` in Discord, then ask your question. Here are some examples:

1. **Getting Documentation Help**
   ```
   How do I add memory to my agent?
   ```
   The bot will provide relevant documentation and code examples.

2. **Code Examples**
   ```
   Show me an example of using workflows
   ```
   The bot will share code examples from the Mastra.ai examples repository.

3. **Development Support**
   ```
   What's the best way to implement voice in my agent?
   ```
   The bot will guide you through implementation options and best practices.

## Response Guidelines

The bot structures responses in two parts:

1. **Documentation and Examples**
   - Links to relevant sections in Mastra.ai docs
   - Uses MCP docs server to find information
   - Links to relevant GitHub examples

2. **Explanations**
   - References specific Mastra features
   - Explains concepts and implementation details
   - Provides context for documentation and examples

## Best Practices

1. **Message Format**
   - Keep questions under 2000 characters
   - Wait a few seconds between messages
   - Long responses will be split into multiple messages

2. **Asking Questions**
   - Ask about specific Mastra features or concepts
   - Include context about what you're building
   - Use threads to organize different topics
