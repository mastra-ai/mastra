# Tone Consistency Scorer

The `createToneScorer()` function evaluates the text's emotional tone and sentiment consistency. It can operate in two modes: comparing tone between input/output pairs or analyzing tone stability within a single text.

## Parameters

The `createToneScorer()` function does not take any options.

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The id of the run (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzeStepResult",
      type: "object",
      description:
        "Object with tone metrics: { responseSentiment: number, referenceSentiment: number, difference: number } (for comparison mode) OR { avgSentiment: number, sentimentVariance: number } (for stability mode)",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description: "Tone consistency/stability score (0-1).",
    },
  ]}
/>

`.run()` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  runId: string,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    responseSentiment?: number,
    referenceSentiment?: number,
    difference?: number,
    avgSentiment?: number,
    sentimentVariance?: number,
  },
  score: number
}
```

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates sentiment consistency through tone pattern analysis and mode-specific scoring.

### Scoring Process

1. Analyzes tone patterns:
   - Extracts sentiment features
   - Computes sentiment scores
   - Measures tone variations
2. Calculates mode-specific score:
   **Tone Consistency** (input and output):
   - Compares sentiment between texts
   - Calculates sentiment difference
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_difference / max_difference)
     **Tone Stability** (single input):
   - Analyzes sentiment across sentences
   - Calculates sentiment variance
   - Score = 1 - (sentiment_variance / max_variance)

Final score: `mode_specific_score * scale`

### Score interpretation

(0 to scale, default 0-1)

- 1.0: Perfect tone consistency/stability
- 0.7-0.9: Strong consistency with minor variations
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate consistency with noticeable shifts
- 0.1-0.3: Poor consistency with major tone changes
- 0.0: No consistency - completely different tones

### analyzeStepResult

Object with tone metrics:

- **responseSentiment**: Sentiment score for the response (comparison mode).
- **referenceSentiment**: Sentiment score for the input/reference (comparison mode).
- **difference**: Absolute difference between sentiment scores (comparison mode).
- **avgSentiment**: Average sentiment across sentences (stability mode).
- **sentimentVariance**: Variance of sentiment across sentences (stability mode).

## Examples

### Positive tone example

In this example, the texts exhibit a similar positive sentiment. The scorer measures the consistency between the tones, resulting in a high score.

```typescript title="src/example-positive-tone.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createToneScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createToneScorer();

const input = "This product is fantastic and amazing!";
const output = "The product is excellent and wonderful!";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: input }],
  output: { role: "assistant", text: output },
});

console.log("Score:", result.score);
console.log("AnalyzeStepResult:", result.analyzeStepResult);
```

#### Positive tone output

The scorer returns a high score reflecting strong sentiment alignment. The `analyzeStepResult` field provides sentiment values and the difference between them.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.8333333333333335,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    responseSentiment: 1.3333333333333333,
    referenceSentiment: 1.1666666666666667,
    difference: 0.16666666666666652,
  },
}
```

### Stable tone example

In this example, the text’s internal tone consistency is analyzed by passing an empty response. This signals the scorer to evaluate sentiment stability within the single input text, resulting in a score reflecting how uniform the tone is throughout.

```typescript title="src/example-stable-tone.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createToneScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createToneScorer();

const input = "Great service! Friendly staff. Perfect atmosphere.";
const output = "";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: input }],
  output: { role: "assistant", text: output },
});

console.log("Score:", result.score);
console.log("AnalyzeStepResult:", result.analyzeStepResult);
```

#### Stable tone output

The scorer returns a high score indicating consistent sentiment throughout the input text. The `analyzeStepResult` field includes the average sentiment and sentiment variance, reflecting tone stability.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.9444444444444444,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    avgSentiment: 1.3333333333333333,
    sentimentVariance: 0.05555555555555556,
  },
}
```

### Mixed tone example

In this example, the input and response have different emotional tones. The scorer picks up on these variations and gives a lower consistency score.

```typescript title="src/example-mixed-tone.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createToneScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createToneScorer();

const input =
  "The interface is frustrating and confusing, though it has potential.";
const output =
  "The design shows promise but needs significant improvements to be usable.";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: input }],
  output: { role: "assistant", text: output },
});

console.log("Score:", result.score);
console.log("AnalyzeStepResult:", result.analyzeStepResult);
```

#### Mixed tone output

The scorer returns a low score due to the noticeable differences in emotional tone. The `analyzeStepResult` field highlights the sentiment values and the degree of variation between them.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.4181818181818182,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    responseSentiment: -0.4,
    referenceSentiment: 0.18181818181818182,
    difference: 0.5818181818181818,
  },
}
```
