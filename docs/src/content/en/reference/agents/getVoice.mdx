The `.getVoice()` method retrieves the voice provider configured for an agent, resolving it if it's a function. This method is used to access the agent's speech capabilities for text-to-speech and speech-to-text functionality.

## Usage example

await agent.getVoice();
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "{ requestContext?: RequestContext }",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "{}",
      description: "Optional configuration object containing request context.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "voice",
      type: "Promise<MastraVoice>",
      description:
        "A promise that resolves to the voice provider configured for the agent, or a default voice provider if none was configured.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Extended usage example

```typescript copy
await agent.getVoice({
  requestContext: new RequestContext(),
});
```
