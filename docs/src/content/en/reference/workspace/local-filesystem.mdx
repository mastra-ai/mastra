# LocalFilesystem

Stores files in a directory on the local filesystem.

:::info

For interface details, see [WorkspaceFilesystem Interface](/reference/workspace/filesystem).

:::

## Installation

`LocalFilesystem` is included in `@mastra/core`:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/core@latest
```

## Usage

```typescript
import { LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace';

const filesystem = new LocalFilesystem({
  basePath: './workspace',
});
```

## Constructor Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "basePath",
      type: "string",
      description: "Base directory path on disk. All file paths are resolved relative to this directory.",
    },
    {
      name: "id",
      type: "string",
      description: "Unique identifier for this filesystem instance",
      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "Auto-generated",
    },
    {

      isOptional: true,
      defaultValue: "false",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Path Resolution

### How basePath works

The `basePath` option sets the root directory for all file operations. File paths passed to methods like `readFile()` are resolved relative to this base:

- Leading slashes are stripped: `/docs/guide.md` → `docs/guide.md`
- The path is normalized and joined with basePath
- Result: `./workspace` + `docs/guide.md` → `./workspace/docs/guide.md`

```typescript
const filesystem = new LocalFilesystem({
  basePath: './workspace',
});

// These all resolve to ./workspace/docs/guide.md
await filesystem.readFile('/docs/guide.md');
await filesystem.readFile('docs/guide.md');
```

### Relative paths and execution context

When you use a relative path for `basePath`, it resolves from `process.cwd()`. In Mastra projects, cwd varies depending on how you run your code:

| Context | Working directory | `./workspace` resolves to |
|---------|------------------|---------------------------|
| `mastra dev` | `./src/mastra/public/` | `./src/mastra/public/workspace` |
| `mastra start` | `./.mastra/output/` | `./.mastra/output/workspace` |
| Direct script | Where you ran the command | Relative to that location |

This can cause confusion when the same relative path resolves to different locations.

### Recommended: Use absolute paths

For consistent paths across all execution contexts, use an environment variable with an absolute path:

```typescript
import { LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace';

const filesystem = new LocalFilesystem({
  basePath: process.env.WORKSPACE_PATH!,
});
```

Set `WORKSPACE_PATH` in your environment to an absolute path like `/home/user/my-project/workspace`. This ensures the workspace path is consistent regardless of how you run your code.
