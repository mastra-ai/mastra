# MCPServer

The `MCPServer` class provides the functionality to expose your existing Mastra tools and Agents as a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server. This allows any MCP client (like Cursor, Windsurf, or Claude Desktop) to connect to these capabilities and make them available to an agent.

Note that if you only need to use your tools or agents directly within your Mastra application, you don't necessarily need to create an MCP server. This API is specifically for exposing your Mastra tools and agents to *external* MCP clients.

It supports both [stdio (subprocess) and SSE (HTTP) MCP transports](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports).

## Constructor

To create a new `MCPServer`, you need to provide some basic information about your server, the tools it will offer, and optionally, any agents you want to expose as tools.

```typescript
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { z } from "zod";

const myAgent = new Agent({
  name: "MyExampleAgent",
  description: "A generalist to help with basic questions."
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
});

const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Gets the current weather for a location.",
  inputSchema: z.object({ location: z.string() }),
  execute: async ({ context }) => `Weather in ${context.location} is sunny.`,
});

const server = new MCPServer({
  name: "My Custom Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: { weatherTool },
  agents: { myAgent }, // this agent will become tool "ask_myAgent"
});
```

### Configuration Properties

The constructor accepts an `MCPServerConfig` object with the following properties:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      isOptional: false,

## Exposing Agents as Tools

A powerful feature of `MCPServer` is its ability to automatically expose your Mastra Agents as callable tools. When you provide agents in the `agents` property of the configuration:

- **Tool Naming**: Each agent is converted into a tool named `ask_<agentKey>`, where `<agentKey>` is the key you used for that agent in the `agents` object. For instance, if you configure `agents: { myAgentKey: myAgentInstance }`, a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` will be created.

- **Tool Functionality**:
    - **Description**: The generated tool's description will be in the format: "Ask agent '<AgentName>' a question. Original agent instructions: <agent description>".
    - **Input**: The tool expects a single object argument with a `message` property (string): `{ message: "Your question for the agent" }`.
    - **Execution**: When this tool is called, it invokes the `generate()` method of the corresponding agent, passing the provided `query`.
    - **Output**: The direct result from the agent's `generate()` method is returned as the output of the tool.

- **Name Collisions**: If an explicit tool defined in the `tools` configuration has the same name as an agent-derived tool (e.g., you have a tool named `ask_myAgentKey` and also an agent with the key `myAgentKey`), the *explicitly defined tool will take precedence*. The agent will not be converted into a tool in this conflicting case, and a warning will be logged.

This makes it straightforward to allow MCP clients to interact with your agents using natural language queries, just like any other tool.

### Agent-to-Tool Conversion

When you provide agents in the `agents` configuration property, `MCPServer` will automatically create a corresponding tool for each agent. The tool will be named `ask_<agentIdentifier>`, where `<agentIdentifier>` is the key you used in the `agents` object.

The description for this generated tool will be: "Ask agent \\'<agent.name>\\' a question. Agent description: <agent.description>".

**Important**: For an agent to be converted into a tool, it **must** have a non-empty `description` string property set in its configuration when it was instantiated (e.g., `new Agent({ name: 'myAgent', description: 'This agent does X.', ... })`). If an agent is passed to `MCPServer` with a missing or empty `description`, an error will be thrown when the `MCPServer` is instantiated, and server setup will fail.

This allows you to quickly expose the generative capabilities of your agents through the MCP, enabling clients to "ask" your agents questions directly.

## Methods

These are the functions you can call on an `MCPServer` instance to control its behavior and get information.

### startStdio()

Use this method to start the server so it communicates using standard input and output (stdio). This is typical when running the server as a command-line program.

```typescript
async startStdio(): Promise<void>
```

Here's how you would start the server using stdio:

```typescript
const server = new MCPServer({
  // example configuration above
});
await server.startStdio();
```

### startSSE()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/sse`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || "", `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: "/sse",
    messagePath: "/message",
    req,
    res,
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startSSE` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "url",
      type: "URL",
      description: "The web address the user is requesting.",
    },
    {
      name: "ssePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/sse').",
    },
    {
      name: "messagePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').",
    },
    {
      name: "req",
      type: "any",
      description: "The incoming request object from your web server.",
    },
    {
      name: "res",
      type: "any",
      description:
        "The response object from your web server, used to send data back.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### startHonoSSE()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startHonoSSE({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHonoSSE` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/hono-sse`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHonoSSE({
    url: new URL(req.url || "", `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: "/hono-sse",
    messagePath: "/message",
    req,
    res,
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHonoSSE` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "url",
      type: "URL",
      description: "The web address the user is requesting.",
    },
    {
      name: "ssePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/hono-sse').",
    },
    {
      name: "messagePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').",
    },
    {
      name: "req",
      type: "any",
      description: "The incoming request object from your web server.",
    },
    {
      name: "res",
      type: "any",
      description:
        "The response object from your web server, used to send data back.",
    },
  ]}
/>

### startHTTP()

This method helps you integrate the MCP server with an existing web server to use Server-Sent Events (SSE) for communication. You'll call this from your web server's code when it receives a request for the SSE or message paths.

```typescript
async startHTTP({
  url,
  ssePath,
  messagePath,
  req,
  res,
}: {
  url: URL;
  ssePath: string;
  messagePath: string;
  req: any;
  res: any;
}): Promise<void>
```

Here's an example of how you might use `startHTTP` within an HTTP server request handler. In this example an MCP client could connect to your MCP server at `http://localhost:1234/http`:

```typescript
import http from "http";

const httpServer = http.createServer(async (req, res) => {
  await server.startHTTP({
    url: new URL(req.url || "", `http://localhost:1234`),
    ssePath: "/http",
    messagePath: "/message",
    req,
    res,
  });
});

httpServer.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`HTTP server listening on port ${PORT}`);
});
```

Here are the details for the values needed by the `startHTTP` method:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "url",
      type: "URL",
      description: "The web address the user is requesting.",
    },
    {
      name: "ssePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will connect for SSE (e.g., '/http').",
    },
    {
      name: "messagePath",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The specific part of the URL where clients will send messages (e.g., '/message').",
    },
    {
      name: "req",
      type: "any",
      description: "The incoming request object from your web server.",
    },
    {
      name: "res",
      type: "any",
      description:
        "The response object from your web server, used to send data back.",
    },
  ]}
/>

      type: "any",
      description: "The arguments to pass to the tool\'s execute function.",
    },
    {
      name: "executionContext",
      type: "object",
      isOptional: true,
      description: "Optional context for the tool execution, like messages or a toolCallId.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Resource Handling

### What are MCP Resources?

Resources are a core primitive in the Model Context Protocol (MCP) that allow servers to expose data and content that can be read by clients and used as context for LLM interactions. They represent any kind of data that an MCP server wants to make available, such as:

- File contents
- Database records
- API responses
- Live system data
- Screenshots and images
- Log files

Resources are identified by unique URIs (e.g., `file:///home/user/documents/report.pdf`, `postgres://database/customers/schema`) and can contain either text (UTF-8 encoded) or binary data (base64 encoded).

Clients can discover resources through:
1.  **Direct resources**: Servers expose a list of concrete resources via a `resources/list` endpoint.
2.  **Resource templates**: For dynamic resources, servers can expose URI templates (RFC 6570) that clients use to construct resource URIs.

To read a resource, clients make a `resources/read` request with the URI. Servers can also notify clients about changes to the resource list (`notifications/resources/list_changed`) or updates to specific resource content (`notifications/resources/updated`) if a client has subscribed to that resource.

For more detailed information, refer to the [official MCP documentation on Resources](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/resources).

### `MCPServerResources` Type

The `resources` option takes an object of type `MCPServerResources`. This type defines the callbacks your server will use to handle resource requests:

```typescript
export type MCPServerResources = {
  // Callback to list available resources
  listResources: () => Promise<Resource[]>;

  // Callback to get the content of a specific resource
  getResourceContent: ({ uri }: { uri: string; }) => Promise<MCPServerResourceContent | MCPServerResourceContent[]>;

  // Optional callback to list available resource templates
  resourceTemplates?: () => Promise<ResourceTemplate[]>;
};

export type MCPServerResourceContent = { text?: string } | { blob?: string };
```

Example:

```typescript
import { MCPServer } from "@mastra/mcp";
import type { MCPServerResourceContent, Resource, ResourceTemplate } from "@mastra/mcp";

// Resources/resource templates will generally be dynamically fetched.
const myResources: Resource[] = [
  { uri: "file://data/123.txt", name: "Data File", mimeType: "text/plain" },
];

const myResourceContents: Record<string, MCPServerResourceContent> = {
  "file://data.txt/123": { text: "This is the content of the data file." },
};

const myResourceTemplates: ResourceTemplate[] = [
  {
    uriTemplate: 'file://data/{id}',
    name: 'Data File',
    description: 'A file containing data.',
    mimeType: 'text/plain',
  },
];

const myResourceHandlers: MCPServerResources = {
  listResources: async () => myResources,
  getResourceContent: async ({ uri }) => {
    if (myResourceContents[uri]) {
      return myResourceContents[uri];
    }
    throw new Error(`Resource content not found for ${uri}`);
  },
  resourceTemplates: async () => myResourceTemplates,
};

const serverWithResources = new MCPServer({
  name: "Resourceful Server",
  version: "1.0.0",
  tools: { /* ... your tools ... */ },
  resources: myResourceHandlers,
});
```

### Notifying Clients of Resource Changes

If the available resources or their content change, your server can notify connected clients that are subscribed to the specific resource.

#### `server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string })`

Call this method when the content of a specific resource (identified by its `uri`) has been updated. If any clients are subscribed to this URI, they will receive a `notifications/resources/updated` message.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: string }): Promise<void>
```

Example:
```typescript
// After updating the content of 'file://data.txt'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyUpdated({ uri: "file://data.txt" });
```

#### `server.resources.notifyListChanged()`

Call this method when the overall list of available resources has changed (e.g., a resource was added or removed). This will send a `notifications/resources/list_changed` message to clients, prompting them to re-fetch the list of resources.

```typescript
async server.resources.notifyListChanged(): Promise<void>
```

Example:
```typescript
// After adding a new resource to the list managed by 'myResourceHandlers.listResources'
await serverWithResources.resources.notifyListChanged();
```
