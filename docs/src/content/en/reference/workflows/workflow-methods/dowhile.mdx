# Workflow.dowhile()

The `.dowhile()` method creates a loop that executes a step while a condition is met.

`.dowhile()` always execute the step at least once. It first executes the step and then evaluates the condition. While the condition is met, these actions are repeated.

Because the step is always executed at least once, the first time the condition is evaluated, the value of `iterationCount` will be 1.

## Usage example

```typescript copy
workflow.dowhile(step1, async ({ inputData }) => true);
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "step",
      type: "Step",
      description: "The step instance to execute in the loop",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "condition",
      type: "(params : ExecuteParams & { iterationCount: number }) => Promise<boolean>",
      description:
        "A function that returns a boolean indicating whether to continue the loop. The function receives the execution parameters and the iteration count.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "workflow",
      type: "Workflow",
      description: "The workflow instance for method chaining",
    },
  ]}
/>
