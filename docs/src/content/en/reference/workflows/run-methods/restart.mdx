# Run.restart()

The `.restart()` method restarts an active workflow run that lost connection to the server, allowing you to continue execution from the moment it lost connection (the last active step).

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRun();

const result = await run.start({ inputData: { value: "initial data" } });

//.. server connection lost,

const restartedResult = await run.restart();
```
