# Run.resumeStream() 


The `.resumeStream()` method resumes a suspended workflow run with new data, allowing you to continue execution from a specific step and to observe the stream of events.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});


const result = await stream.result;
if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedStream = await run.resumeStream({
    resumeData: { value: "resume data" }
  });
}
```

    },
  ]}
/>

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics
