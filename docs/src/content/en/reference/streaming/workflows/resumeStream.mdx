# Run.resumeStream() 


The `.resumeStream()` method resumes a suspended workflow run with new data, allowing you to continue execution from a specific step and to observe the stream of events.

## Usage example

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data",
  },
});


const result = await stream.result;
if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedStream = await run.resumeStream({
    resumeData: { value: "resume data" }
  });
}
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "resumeData",
      type: "z.infer<TInput>",
      description: "Input data that matches the workflow's input schema",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "runtimeContext",
      type: "RuntimeContext",
      description: "Runtime context data to use during workflow execution",
      isOptional: true,
    },
    {
      name: "step",
      type: "Step<string, any, any, any, any, TEngineType>",
      description: "The step to resume execution from",
      isOptional: true,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "stream",
      type: "MastraWorkflowStream<ChunkType>",
      description: "A custom stream that extends ReadableStream<ChunkType> with additional workflow-specific properties",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.status",
      type: "Promise<RunStatus>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to the current workflow run status",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.result",
      type: "Promise<WorkflowResult<TOutput, TSteps>>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to the final workflow result",
    },
    {
      name: "stream.usage",
      type: "Promise<{ inputTokens: number; outputTokens: number; totalTokens: number, reasoningTokens?: number, cacheInputTokens?: number }>",
      description: "A promise that resolves to token usage statistics",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Stream Events

The stream emits various event types during workflow execution. Each event has a `type` field and a `payload` containing relevant data:

- **`workflow-start`**: Workflow execution begins
- **`workflow-step-start`**: A step begins execution
- **`workflow-step-output`**: Custom output from a step
- **`workflow-step-result`**: A step completes with results
- **`workflow-finish`**: Workflow execution completes with usage statistics
