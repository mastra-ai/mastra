# Content Similarity Scorer

The `createContentSimilarityScorer()` function measures the textual similarity between two strings, providing a score that indicates how closely they match. It supports configurable options for case sensitivity and whitespace handling.

## Parameters

The `createContentSimilarityScorer()` function accepts a single options object with the following properties:

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "ignoreCase",
      type: "boolean",
      required: false,
      defaultValue: "true",
      description: "Whether to ignore case differences when comparing strings.",
    },
    {
      name: "ignoreWhitespace",
      type: "boolean",
      required: false,
      defaultValue: "true",
      description: "Whether to normalize whitespace when comparing strings.",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The id of the run (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "preprocessStepResult",
      type: "object",
      description:
        "Object with processed input and output: { processedInput: string, processedOutput: string }",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzeStepResult",
      type: "object",
      description: "Object with similarity: { similarity: number }",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description:
        "Similarity score (0-1) where 1 indicates perfect similarity.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Scoring Details

The scorer evaluates textual similarity through character-level matching and configurable text normalization.

### Scoring Process

1. Normalizes text:
   - Case normalization (if ignoreCase: true)
   - Whitespace normalization (if ignoreWhitespace: true)
2. Compares processed strings using string-similarity algorithm:
   - Analyzes character sequences
   - Aligns word boundaries
   - Considers relative positions
   - Accounts for length differences

Final score: `similarity_value * scale`

## Examples

### High similarity example

In this example, the response closely resembles the query in both structure and meaning. Minor differences in tense and phrasing do not significantly affect the overall similarity.

```typescript title="src/example-high-similarity.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createContentSimilarityScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createContentSimilarityScorer();

const query = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
const response = "A quick brown fox jumped over a lazy dog.";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: query }],
  output: { text: response },
});

console.log(result);
```

#### High similarity output

The output receives a high score because the response preserves the intent and content of the query with only subtle wording changes.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.7761194029850746,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    similarity: 0.7761194029850746
  },
}
```

### Moderate similarity example

In this example, the response shares some conceptual overlap with the query but diverges in structure and wording. Key elements remain present, but the phrasing introduces moderate variation.

```typescript title="src/example-moderate-similarity.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createContentSimilarityScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createContentSimilarityScorer();

const query = "A brown fox quickly leaps across a sleeping dog.";
const response = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: query }],
  output: { text: response },
});

console.log(result);
```

#### Moderate similarity output

The output receives a mid-range score because the response captures the general idea of the query, though it differs enough in wording to reduce overall similarity.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.40540540540540543,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    similarity: 0.40540540540540543
  }
}
```

### Low similarity example

In this example, the response and query are unrelated in meaning, despite having a similar grammatical structure. There is little to no shared content overlap.

```typescript title="src/example-low-similarity.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createContentSimilarityScorer } from "@mastra/evals/scorers/prebuilt";

const scorer = createContentSimilarityScorer();

const query = "The cat sleeps on the windowsill.";
const response = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";

const result = await scorer.run({
  input: [{ role: "user", content: query }],
  output: { text: response },
});

console.log(result);
```

#### Low similarity output

The output receives a low score because the response does not align with the content or intent of the query.

```typescript
{
  score: 0.25806451612903225,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    similarity: 0.25806451612903225
  },
}
```

### Score interpretation

A similarity score between 0 and 1:

- **1.0**: Perfect match – content is nearly identical.
- **0.7–0.9**: High similarity – minor differences in word choice or structure.
- **0.4–0.6**: Moderate similarity – general overlap with noticeable variation.
- **0.1–0.3**: Low similarity – few common elements or shared meaning.
- **0.0**: No similarity – completely different content.
