# MastraScorer

The `MastraScorer` class is the base class for all scorers in Mastra. It provides a standard `.run()` method for evaluating input/output pairs and supports multi-step scoring workflows. Most users will use `createScorer` or `createLLMScorer`, but advanced users can subclass or instantiate `MastraScorer` directly for full control.

## Step Function Signatures

### extract
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: false,
      description: "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description: "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ results: any }`  
The method must return an object with a `results` property. The value of `results` will be passed to the analyze function as `extractStepResult`.

### analyze
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: true,
      description: "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description: "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "extractStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Result of the extract step, if defined (optional).",
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ score: number, results?: any }`  
The method must return an object with a `score` property (required). Optionally, it may return a `results` property. The value of `results` will be passed to the reason function as `analyzeStepResult`.

### reason
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: true,
      description: "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description: "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      required: true,
      description: "Score computed by the analyze step.",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzeStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: true,
      description: "Result of the analyze step.",
    },
    {
      name: "extractStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Result of the extract step, if defined (optional).",  
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ reason: string }`  
The method must return an object with a `reason` property, which should be a string explaining the score.

All step functions can be async.
