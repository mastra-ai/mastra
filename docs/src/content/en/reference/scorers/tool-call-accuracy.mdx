# Tool Call Accuracy Scorer

The `createToolCallAccuracyScorer()` function evaluates whether an LLM selects the correct tool from a list of available tools for a given task. It provides binary scoring based on tool selection accuracy and supports both strict and lenient evaluation modes.

For a usage example, see the [Tool Call Accuracy Examples](/examples/scorers/tool-call-accuracy).

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "expectedTool",
      type: "string",
      description: "The name of the tool that should be called for the given task.",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "strictMode",
      type: "boolean",
      description: "When true, only exact single tool calls are accepted. When false (default), the expected tool can be among multiple tools called.",
      required: false,
      default: "false",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## .run() Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "runId",
      type: "string",
      description: "The id of the run (optional).",
    },
    {
      name: "preprocessStepResult",
      type: "object",
      description: "Object with tool call analysis: { expectedTool: string, actualTools: string[], strictMode: boolean, hasToolCalls: boolean, correctToolCalled: boolean }",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description: "Tool call accuracy score (0 or 1) where 1 indicates the correct tool was called.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Evaluation Modes

### Standard Mode (strictMode: false)

In standard mode, the scorer returns `1` if the expected tool is called, regardless of whether other tools are also called. This is useful for evaluating tool selection in multi-tool scenarios.

### Strict Mode (strictMode: true)

In strict mode, the scorer returns `1` only if exactly one tool is called and it matches the expected tool. This is useful for evaluating precise tool selection where calling multiple tools would be incorrect.

## Tool Call Detection

The scorer analyzes tool invocations in the LLM output, examining both:

- Tool calls in `call` state (tools being invoked)
- Tool calls in `result` state (tools that have completed execution)

## Scoring Details

The scorer provides binary evaluation of tool selection accuracy.

### Scoring Process

1. **Extract Tool Calls**: Identifies all tool invocations from the LLM output
2. **Compare Against Expected**: Checks if the expected tool was called
3. **Apply Mode Logic**: Applies strict or standard mode evaluation rules
4. **Return Binary Score**: Returns 1 for correct tool selection, 0 otherwise

### Score Interpretation

- **1.0**: Correct tool selection according to the specified mode
- **0.0**: Incorrect tool selection or no tools called

### Standard Mode Examples

```typescript
// Expected: weather-tool
// Actual: [weather-tool] → Score: 1
// Actual: [weather-tool, calendar-tool] → Score: 1
// Actual: [calendar-tool] → Score: 0
// Actual: [] → Score: 0
```

### Strict Mode Examples

```typescript
// Expected: weather-tool
// Actual: [weather-tool] → Score: 1
// Actual: [weather-tool, calendar-tool] → Score: 0
// Actual: [calendar-tool] → Score: 0
// Actual: [] → Score: 0
```

## Use Cases

- **Tool Selection Testing**: Verify agents call the right tools for specific tasks
- **Multi-Tool Scenarios**: Evaluate tool selection in complex workflows
- **Tool Training**: Assess model performance on tool selection tasks
- **Quality Assurance**: Automated testing of tool-calling behavior
