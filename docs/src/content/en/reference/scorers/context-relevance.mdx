# Context Relevance Scorer

The `createContextRelevanceScorerLLM()` function creates a scorer that evaluates how relevant and useful provided context was for generating agent responses. It uses weighted relevance levels and applies penalties for unused high-relevance context and missing information.

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "model",
      type: "MastraLanguageModel",
      description: "The language model to use for evaluating context relevance",
      required: true,
    },
    {
      name: "options",
      type: "ContextRelevanceOptions",
      description: "Configuration options for the scorer",
      required: true,
      children: [
        {
          name: "context",
          type: "string[]",
          description: "Array of context pieces to evaluate for relevance",
          required: false,
        },
        {
          name: "contextExtractor",
          type: "(input, output) => string[]",
          description: "Function to dynamically extract context from the run input and output",
          required: false,
        },
        {
          name: "scale",
          type: "number",
          description: "Scale factor to multiply the final score (default: 1)",
          required: false,
        },
      ],
    },
  ]}
/>

:::note
Either `context` or `contextExtractor` must be provided. If both are provided, `contextExtractor` takes precedence.

## Scoring Details

### Weighted Relevance Scoring

Context Relevance uses a sophisticated scoring algorithm that considers:

1. **Relevance Levels**: Each context piece is classified with weighted values:
   - `high` = 1.0 (directly addresses the query)
   - `medium` = 0.7 (supporting information)
   - `low` = 0.3 (tangentially related)
   - `none` = 0.0 (completely irrelevant)

2. **Usage Detection**: Tracks whether relevant context was actually used in the response

3. **Penalties Applied**:
   - **Unused High-Relevance**: 10% penalty per unused high-relevance context
   - **Missing Context**: Up to 50% penalty for identified missing information

### Scoring Formula

```
Base Score = Σ(relevance_weights) / (num_contexts × 1.0)
Usage Penalty = count(unused_high_relevance) × 0.1
Missing Penalty = min(count(missing_context) × 0.15, 0.5)

Final Score = max(0, Base Score - Usage Penalty - Missing Penalty) × scale
```

### Score Interpretation

- **0.9-1.0** = Excellent relevance with minimal gaps
- **0.7-0.8** = Good relevance with some unused or missing context
- **0.4-0.6** = Mixed relevance with significant gaps
- **0.0-0.3** = Poor relevance or mostly irrelevant context

### Difference from Context Precision

| Aspect | Context Relevance | Context Precision |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Algorithm** | Weighted levels with penalties | Mean Average Precision (MAP) |
| **Relevance** | Multiple levels (high/medium/low/none) | Binary (yes/no) |
| **Position** | Not considered | Critical (rewards early placement) |
| **Usage** | Tracks and penalizes unused context | Not considered |
| **Missing** | Identifies and penalizes gaps | Not evaluated |

## Usage Patterns

### Content Generation Evaluation
Best for evaluating context quality in:
- Chat systems where context usage matters
- RAG pipelines needing nuanced relevance assessment
- Systems where missing context affects quality

### Context Selection Optimization
Use when optimizing for:
- Comprehensive context coverage
- Effective context utilization
- Identifying context gaps
