# createScorer

Mastra allows you to define your own custom code scorers for evaluating input/output pairs using any logic you choose. Custom scorers integrate seamlessly with the Mastra scoring framework and can be used anywhere built-in scorers are used.

For a usage example, see the [Custom Code Scorer Examples](/examples/scorers/custom-native-javascript-eval).

## How to Create a Custom Scorer

Use the `createScorer` factory to define your scorer. You must provide at least a `name`, `description`, and an `analyze` function. Optionally, you can provide `extract` and `reason` functions for multi-step or more advanced logic.

## createScorer Options

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Name of the scorer.",
    },
    {
      name: "description",
      type: "string",
      required: true,
      description: "Description of what the scorer does.",
    },
    {
      name: "analyze",
      type: "function",
      required: true,
      description: "Main scoring logic",
    },
    {
      name: "extract",
      type: "function",
      required: false,
      description: "Optional pre-processing step.",
    },
    {
      name: "reason",
      type: "function",
      required: false,
      description: "Optional reason/explanation step.",
    },
    {
      name: "metadata",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Optional metadata for the scorer.",
    },
  ]}
/>

This function returns an instance of the MastraScorer class. See the [MastraScorer reference](./mastra-scorer) for details on the `.run()` method and its input/output.

## Step Function Signatures


### extract
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: false,
      description:
        "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ results: any }`  
The method must return an object with a `results` property. The value of `results` will be passed to the analyze function as `extractStepResult`.

### analyze
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "extractStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Result of the extract step, if defined (optional).",
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ score: number, results?: any }`  
The method must return an object with a `score` property (required). Optionally, it may return a `results` property. The value of `results` will be passed to the reason function as `analyzeStepResult`.


### reason
<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "Record<string, any>[]",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Input records provided to the scorer. If the scorer is added to an agent, this will be an array of user messages, e.g. `[{ role: 'user', content: 'hello world' }]`. If the scorer is used in a workflow, this will be the input of the workflow.",
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "Record<string, any>",
      required: true,
      description:
        "Output record provided to the scorer. For agents, this is usually the agent's response. For workflows, this is the workflow's output.",
    },
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      required: true,
      description: "Score computed by the analyze step.",
    },
    {
      name: "analyzeStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: true,
      description: "Result of the analyze step.",
    },
    {
      name: "extractStepResult",
      type: "object",
      required: false,
      description: "Result of the extract step, if defined (optional).",  
    },
  ]}
/>
Returns: `{ reason: string }`  
The method must return an object with a `reason` property, which should be a string explaining the score.

All step functions can be async.
