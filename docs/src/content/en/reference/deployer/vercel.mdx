# VercelDeployer

The VercelDeployer deploys standalone Mastra applications to Vercel, handling configuration, environment variable synchronization, and deployment processes. It extends the abstract Deployer class to provide Vercel-specific deployment functionality.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/deployer-vercel@latest
```

## Usage Example

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { VercelDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-vercel";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  deployer: new VercelDeployer()
});
```

## Lint Mastra Project

Lint your Mastra project to make sure it's fine to build

```bash
npx mastra lint
```

## Build Mastra Project

To build your Mastra project for Vercel deployment:

```bash
npx mastra build
```

The build process generates the following output structure in the `.vercel/output` directory:

```
.vercel/output/functions/index.func
└── index.mjs       # Application entry point
```

## Deployment Options

After building, you can deploy your Mastra application to Vercel using any of these methods:

1. **Vercel CLI**: Deploy directly using Vercel's official CLI tool

   - Install the CLI: `npm install -g vercel`
   - Deploy to preview environment: `vercel --prebuilt`
   - For production deployment: `vercel --prod --prebuilt`

2. **Vercel Dashboard**: Connect your Git repository or drag-and-drop the build output through the Vercel dashboard

> You can also run `vercel dev` in your project directory to test your Mastra application locally. (Make sure you configured your dev command to `mastra dev`)
