# NetlifyDeployer

The `NetlifyDeployer` class handles packaging, configuration, and deployment by adapting Mastra's output to create an optimized version of your server. It extends the base [`Deployer`](/reference/deployer/) class with Netlify specific functionality. It enables you to run Mastra within Netlify serverless functions or edge functions.

## Installation

In order to use `NetlifyDeployer`, you need to install the `@mastra/deployer-netlify` package:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify@latest
```

## Usage example

Import `NetlifyDeployer` and set it as the deployer in your Mastra configuration:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
// highlight-next-line
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // highlight-next-line
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer(),
});
```

## Constructor options

- `target?: 'serverless' | 'edge'` — Deploy target for Netlify. Defaults to `'serverless'`.
  - `'serverless'` — Standard [Netlify Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/functions/overview/) (Node.js runtime, 10s default timeout).
  - `'edge'` — [Netlify Edge Functions](https://docs.netlify.com/build/edge-functions/overview/) (Deno-based runtime, runs at the edge closest to users, no hard timeout).

### Edge functions example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer({
    target: "edge",
  }),
});
```

## Output

After running `mastra build`, the deployer generates a `.netlify` folder. The build output includes all agents, tools, and workflows of your project, alongside a `config.json` file that configures the [Netlify Frameworks API](https://docs.netlify.com/build/frameworks/frameworks-api/).

### Serverless output (default)

```bash
your-project/
└── .netlify/
    └── v1/
        ├── config.json
        └── functions/
            └── api/
                ├── index.mjs
                ├── package.json
                └── node_modules/
```

The `config.json` file contains:

```json
{
  "functions": {
    "directory": ".netlify/v1/functions",
    "node_bundler": "none",
    "included_files": [
      ".netlify/v1/functions/**"
    ]
  },
  "redirects": [
    {
      "force": true,
      "from": "/*",
      "to": "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat",
      "status": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

### Edge output

```bash
your-project/
└── .netlify/
    └── v1/
        ├── config.json
        └── edge-functions/
            ├── index.mjs
            ├── package.json
            └── node_modules/
```

The `config.json` file contains:

```json
{
  "edge_functions": [
    {
      "function": "index",
      "path": "/*"
    }
  ]
}
```
