# NetlifyDeployer

The NetlifyDeployer deploys standalone Mastra applications to Netlify Functions, handling site creation, configuration, and deployment processes. It extends the abstract Deployer class to provide Netlify-specific deployment functionality.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify@latest
```

## Usage Example

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer()
});
```

## Lint Mastra Project

Lint your Mastra project to make sure it's fine to build

```bash
npx mastra lint
```

## Build Mastra Project

To build your Mastra project for Netlify deployment:

```bash
npx mastra build
```

The build process generates the following output structure in the `.mastra/output` directory:

```
.netlify/
├── v1/
    └── functions/
    │   └── api/
    │       └── index.mjs    # Application entry point
    │ config.json            # Netlify configuration
```

### Netlify Configuration

The NetlifyDeployer automatically generates a `config.json` configuration file in `.netlify/v1` with the following settings:

```json
{
  "redirects": [
    {
      "force": true,
      "from": "/*",
      "to": "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat",
      "status": 200
    }
  ]
}
```

## Deployment Options

After building, you can deploy your Mastra application `.mastra/output` to Netlify using any of these methods:

1. **Netlify CLI**: Deploy directly using Netlify's official CLI tool

   - Install the CLI: `npm install -g netlify-cli`
   - Deploy with functions directory specified: `netlify deploy`
   - For production deployment add `--prod` flag: `netlify deploy --prod`

2. **Netlify Dashboard**: Connect your Git repository or drag-and-drop the build output through the Netlify dashboard

  When connecting a Mastra project Git repository to Netlify, use these recommended build settings since Netlify resolves paths relative to the project root:

   ```bash
   # Build command
   npm run build
   ```



3. **Netlify Dev**: Run your Mastra application locally with Netlify's development environment

> You can also run `netlify dev` in your project root to test your Mastra application locally.
