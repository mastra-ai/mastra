# NetlifyDeployer

The `NetlifyDeployer` class handles deployment of standalone Mastra applications to Netlify. It manages configuration, deployment, and extends the base [Deployer](/reference/v1/deployer/) class with Netlify specific functionality.

## Usage example

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer(),
});
```
