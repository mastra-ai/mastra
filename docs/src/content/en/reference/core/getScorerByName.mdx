# getScorerById()

The `getScorerById()` method retrieves a scorer by searching for its `name` property rather than the registration key. This is useful when you know the scorer's display name but not necessarily how it was registered in the Mastra instance.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

// Get a scorer by its name property
const relevancyScorer = mastra.getScorerById("Answer Relevancy");

const weatherAgent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");

// Use the scorer to evaluate an AI output
await weatherAgent.generate("What is the weather in Rome", {
  scorers: {
    answerRelevancy: {
      scorer: relevancyScorer,
    },
  },
});
```

## Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "name",
      type: "string",
      description:
        "The name property of the scorer to retrieve. This should match the 'name' field specified when creating the scorer with createScorer().",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "scorer",
      type: "MastraScorer",
      description:
        "The MastraScorer instance that has the matching name property.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Error Handling

This method throws a `MastraError` if:

- No scorer with the specified name is found
- No scorers are registered with the Mastra instance

```typescript
try {
  const scorer = mastra.getScorerById("Non-existent Scorer");
} catch (error) {
  if (error.id === "MASTRA_GET_SCORER_BY_NAME_NOT_FOUND") {
    console.log("Scorer with that name not found");
  }
}
```
