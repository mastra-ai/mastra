// Get all registered scorers
const allScorers = mastra.listScorers();

// Access a specific scorer
const myScorer = allScorers.relevancyScorer;
```

## Parameters

This method takes no parameters.

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "scorers",
      type: "Record<string, MastraScorer> | undefined",
      description:
        "An object containing all registered scorers, where keys are scorer names and values are MastraScorer instances. Returns undefined if no scorers are registered.",
    },
  ]}
/>
