# Deployment

The `CloudflareDeployer` configuration has been updated to use standard `wrangler.json` property names.

## Changed

### CloudflareDeployer uses standard wrangler.json property names

The `CloudflareDeployer` constructor now accepts standard `wrangler.json` property names instead of custom camelCase variants. This change aligns the deployer with Cloudflare's official configuration format and provides access to all wrangler configuration options.

Deprecated fields are automatically migrated at runtime with console warnings, but you should update your code to use the new field names.

```diff
  const deployer = new CloudflareDeployer({
-   projectName: 'my-worker',
+   name: 'my-worker',
-   d1Databases: [
+   d1_databases: [
      {
        binding: 'DB',
        database_name: 'my-db',
        database_id: 'xxx',
      },
    ],
-   kvNamespaces: [
+   kv_namespaces: [
      {
        binding: 'KV',
        id: 'yyy',
      },
    ],
  });
```

The `workerNamespace` field has been removed as it is no longer used.

For all available configuration options, see the [Wrangler configuration documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
