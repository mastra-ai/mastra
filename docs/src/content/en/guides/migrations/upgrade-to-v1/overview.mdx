## Migration Checklist

Work through this checklist in order, starting with high-impact changes that affect most applications.

:::info[Codemod]

We prepared automated [codemods](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/packages/codemod) for you. Throughout the migration guide you'll find instructions on how to use them for specific changes.

If you want, you can run all v1 codemods at once:

```sh
npx @mastra/codemod v1
```
