# Upgrade to Mastra v1

:::info[First update to latest 0.x version]
Before upgrading to v1, make sure you've updated to the latest 0.x version of Mastra. Follow the [upgrade to latest 0.x guide](https://mastra.ai/guides/migrations/upgrade-to-latest-0x) first, then return here to complete the v1 migration.
:::

Mastra v1 is coming in January 2026. We recommend starting any new projects with the beta, or upgrading your existing project today to get ahead.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of breaking changes when upgrading from Mastra 0.x to v1.0. The migration is organized by package and feature area to help you systematically update your codebase.

## Migration Strategy

### Update all Mastra packages to `beta` tag

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time to ensure compatibility.

Here's how you update the most commonly used packages:

```shell
npm install @mastra/core@beta mastra@beta @mastra/loggers@beta @mastra/memory@beta
```

Install any other Mastra package with the `@beta` tag and you'll get the latest beta version available. Be sure to update all Mastra packages (especially if you're in a monorepo) to avoid version mismatches.

### Update Node.js version

Mastra v1 requires Node.js **22.13.0** or higher. Update your development and production environments accordingly.

### Go through migration checklist

Work through the [migration checklist](#migration-checklist) below to update your codebase. Each item links to a detailed guide for that specific change.

:::info[Codemods]

We prepared automated [codemods](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/packages/codemod) for you. If you want, you can run all v1 codemods at once:

```sh
npx @mastra/codemod@beta v1
```

## Migration Checklist

Work through this checklist in order, starting with high-impact changes that affect most applications.

:::info[Codemods]

We prepared automated [codemods](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/tree/main/packages/codemod) for you. Throughout the migration guide you'll find instructions on how to use them for specific changes.

If you want, you can run all v1 codemods at once:

```sh
