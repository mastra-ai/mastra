# Voice Packages

## Changed

### Changed: Class names from `*TTS` to `*Voice`

TTS class names have been renamed to Voice classes. `MurfTTS`, `SpeechifyTTS`, and `PlayAITTS` are now `MurfVoice`, `SpeechifyVoice`, and `PlayAIVoice` respectively. This change aligns class names with the package rename.

To migrate, update class names in your code.

```diff
- import { MurfTTS } from '@mastra/voice-murf';
- import { SpeechifyTTS } from '@mastra/voice-speechify';
- import { PlayAITTS } from '@mastra/voice-playai';
+ import { MurfVoice } from '@mastra/voice-murf';
+ import { SpeechifyVoice } from '@mastra/voice-speechify';
+ import { PlayAIVoice } from '@mastra/voice-playai';

- const tts = new MurfTTS({ apiKey: '...' });
+ const voice = new MurfVoice({ apiKey: '...' });
```

### Changed: `generate` and `stream` methods to `speak`

The `generate()` and `stream()` methods have been combined into a single `speak()` method. This change simplifies the voice API by consolidating speech generation methods.

To migrate, replace `generate()` and `stream()` calls with `speak()`.

```diff
- await tts.generate('Hello');
- await tts.stream('Hello');
+ await voice.speak('Hello');
```

### Changed: `voices` method to `getSpeakers`

The `voices()` method has been renamed to `getSpeakers()`. This change provides clearer naming that better describes the method's purpose.

To migrate, rename method calls from `voices` to `getSpeakers`.

```diff
- const voices = await tts.voices();
+ const speakers = await voice.getSpeakers();
```

### Changed: Voice configuration property names

Voice configuration properties have been renamed for consistency. `speakProvider` is now `output`, `listenProvider` is now `input`, and `realtimeProvider` is now `realtime`. This change provides more intuitive property names.

To migrate, update configuration property names when configuring agents with voice capabilities.

```diff
  const agent = new Agent({
    voice: {
-     speakProvider: murfVoice,
-     listenProvider: deepgramVoice,
-     realtimeProvider: openaiRealtime,
+     output: murfVoice,
+     input: deepgramVoice,
+     realtime: openaiRealtime,
    },
  });
```

## Removed

### Removed: TTS exports from `@mastra/core`

TTS exports have been removed from `@mastra/core`. All TTS functionality is now in dedicated voice packages. This change improves tree-shaking by removing voice-specific code from the core package.

To migrate, import voice functionality from dedicated voice packages instead of `@mastra/core`.

```diff
- import { TTS } from '@mastra/core/tts';
+ import { MurfVoice } from '@mastra/voice-murf';
+ // or other voice packages as needed
```
