# Voice Packages

Voice packages have been renamed from speech to voice with updated class names and API methods.

## Changed

### Voice configuration property names

Voice configuration properties have been renamed for consistency. `speakProvider` is now `output`, `listenProvider` is now `input`, and `realtimeProvider` is now `realtime`. This change provides more intuitive property names.

To migrate, update configuration property names when configuring agents with voice capabilities.

```diff
  const agent = new Agent({
    voice: {
-     speakProvider: murfVoice,
-     listenProvider: deepgramVoice,
-     realtimeProvider: openaiRealtime,
+     output: murfVoice,
+     input: deepgramVoice,
+     realtime: openaiRealtime,
    },
  });
```

:::tip[Codemod]

You can use Mastra's codemod CLI to update your code automatically:

```shell
npx @mastra/codemod@beta v1/voice-property-names .
```
