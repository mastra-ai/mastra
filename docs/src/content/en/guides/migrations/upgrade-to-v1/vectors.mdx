# Vectors

Vector store methods have been renamed to follow consistent naming conventions.

## Changed

### `getVectors` to `listVectors`

The `getVectors()` method has been renamed to `listVectors()`. This change aligns with the naming convention used across the API where plural getter methods use the `list` prefix.

To migrate, replace all calls to `getVectors()` with `listVectors()`.

```diff
  const vectorStore = new VectorStore({ ... });

- const vectors = await vectorStore.getVectors({ ... });
+ const vectors = await vectorStore.listVectors({ ... });
```
