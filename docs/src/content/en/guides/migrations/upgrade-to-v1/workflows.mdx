### Changed: runCount -> retryCount

### Changed: createRunAsync -> createRun

### Removed: Legacy Workflows

### Removed: Legacy Watch Events (Client SDK)

**Breaking Changes:**

- The `.watch()` method has been removed from the client-js SDK's `Workflow` and `AgentBuilder` classes
- The `/api/workflows/:workflowId/watch` and `/api/agent-builder/:actionId/watch` HTTP endpoints have been removed
- Server-side code using `watch-v2` event types should update to the simplified `watch` API

**Why this change?**

- Simplify the workflow streaming API by consolidating on one implementation
- Remove legacy v1 event system that was superseded by v2
- Improve performance by eliminating duplicate event handling code
- Reduce API surface area and maintenance burden

**Migration:**

If you were using `run.watch()` from `@mastra/client-js`, switch to using `run.stream()`:

```typescript
// Before (v0.22 and earlier)
const workflow = mastraClient.getWorkflow('my-workflow');
const run = await workflow.createRun();

await run.watch((event) => {
  console.log('Step completed:', event);
});

// After (v0.23+)
const workflow = mastraClient.getWorkflow('my-workflow');
const run = await workflow.createRun();

const stream = await run.stream({
  inputData: { /* your input */ }
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log('Step completed:', chunk);
}
```
