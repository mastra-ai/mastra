# Evals & Scorers

The evaluation API has been consolidated on the new scorers system with updated naming conventions and configuration requirements.

## Changed

### `runExperiment` to `runEvals`

The `runExperiment()` function has been renamed to `runEvals()`. This change provides clearer naming that better describes the evaluation functionality.

To migrate, update function calls from `runExperiment` to `runEvals`.

```diff
  import { createScorer, runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals';
  
  const scorer = createScorer({
    id: 'helpfulness-scorer',
    // ...
  });
  
- const result = await runExperiment({ agent, scorer, inputs });
+ const result = await runEvals({ agent, scorer, inputs });
```

### `getScorerByName` to `getScorerById`

The `getScorerByName()` method has been renamed to `getScorerById()`. Scorers now require an `id` field instead of `name`. This change aligns with the broader API pattern of using `id` for entity identification.

To migrate, update method calls and scorer configuration to use `id` instead of `name`.

```diff
  const scorer = createScorer({
-   name: 'helpfulness-scorer',
+   id: 'helpfulness-scorer',
    // ...
  });
  
- const scorer = mastra.getScorerByName('helpfulness-scorer');
+ const scorer = mastra.getScorerById('helpfulness-scorer');
```

### Scorer configuration from `name` to `id`

Scorers now require an `id` field instead of `name`. The `name` field is now optional. This change provides consistency with other Mastra entities.

To migrate, update scorer definitions to use `id` as the required field.

```diff
  const scorer = createScorer({
-   name: 'helpfulness-scorer',
+   id: 'helpfulness-scorer',
+   name: 'Helpfulness Scorer', // optional
    // ...
  });
```

### Storage score APIs to `listScoresBy*` pattern

Score storage APIs have been renamed to follow the `listScoresBy*` pattern. This change aligns with the broader storage API naming conventions.

To migrate, update score query methods to use the new naming pattern.

```diff
- const scores = await storage.getScores({ scorerName: 'helpfulness-scorer' });
+ const scores = await storage.listScoresByScorerId({
+   scorerId: 'helpfulness-scorer',
+ });

// Also available:
// - listScoresByRunId
// - listScoresByEntityId  
// - listScoresBySpan
```

### Processor interface requirements

Processors now require an `id` field instead of `name`. The `name` field is now optional. Message types have changed from `MastraMessageV2` to `MastraDBMessage`. This change provides consistency with scorer configuration and better type safety.

To migrate, update processor definitions to use `id` as the required field and update message types.

```diff
  import type { InputProcessor } from '@mastra/core/processors';
- import type { MastraMessageV2 } from '@mastra/core/agent';
+ import type { MastraDBMessage } from '@mastra/core/agent';
  
  const processor: InputProcessor = {
-   name: 'my-processor',
+   id: 'my-processor',
+   name: 'My Processor', // optional
-   processInput: async ({ messages }: { messages: MastraMessageV2[] }) => {
+   processInput: async ({ messages }: { messages: MastraDBMessage[] }) => {
      // ...
    },
  };
```

## Removed

### Legacy evals code

Legacy evals code has been removed from `@mastra/core`. This includes legacy evaluation metrics, scorer/judge modules, and hook-based automatic evaluation code. This change simplifies the codebase by removing outdated evaluation approaches.

To migrate, use the new evals/scorers API in `@mastra/core/evals` or `@mastra/evals`.

```diff
- // Legacy evals APIs
+ import { createScorer, runEvals } from '@mastra/core/evals';
+ 
+ const scorer = createScorer({
+   id: 'my-scorer',
+   // Use new scorer API
+ });
```

### Agent `TMetrics` generic parameter

The `TMetrics` generic parameter has been removed from `AgentConfig` and the `Agent` constructor. Metrics/scorers are now configured using the scorers API instead of being part of the Agent type system. This change simplifies the Agent type signature.

To migrate, remove the `TMetrics` generic parameter and configure scorers using the scorers API.

```diff
- const agent = new Agent<AgentId, Tools, Metrics>({
+ const agent = new Agent<AgentId, Tools>({
    // ...
  });
```

### Deprecated input processor exports

Deprecated input-processor exports have been removed from `@mastra/core`. This change consolidates processor types under the unified `Processor` interface.

To migrate, use the new `Processor` interface.

```diff
- import { InputProcessor } from '@mastra/core/processors'; // old exports
+ import type { Processor, InputProcessor } from '@mastra/core/processors';
```

### Evals-related type exports

Several evals-related type exports have been removed including `DeprecatedOutputOptions`, `Metric`, and processor option types. These types are now internal or have been replaced by the new scorers API. This change reduces API surface area.

To migrate, remove references to these removed types and use the new scorers API.

```diff
- import type {
-   DeprecatedOutputOptions,
-   Metric,
-   LanguageDetectorOptions,
-   ModerationOptions,
- } from '@mastra/core';
+ // Use new scorers API types
+ import type { Scorer } from '@mastra/core/evals';
```
