# Upgrade to Latest 0.x

:::note Upgrading to Mastra v1?

If your goal is to upgrade to Mastra v1, you should first complete this guide to reach the latest 0.x version. Then, switch to the [v1 documentation](https://mastra.ai/guides/migrations/upgrade-to-v1/overview) and follow the comprehensive [v1 migration guide](https://mastra.ai/guides/migrations/upgrade-to-v1/overview), which covers all breaking changes when upgrading from 0.x to v1, including automated codemods to help with the migration.

:::

This guide walks you through the breaking changes in pre-v1 versions of Mastra (0.x), helping you upgrade step-by-step to the latest 0.x release. You'll find detailed migration instructions for each version, including code examples and explanations of what changed and why.

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time.

:::info

Versions mentioned in the headings refer to the `@mastra/core` package. If necessary, versions of other Mastra packages are called out in the detailed description.

All Mastra packages have a peer dependency on `@mastra/core` so your package manager can inform you about compatibility.

## Migrate to v0.22

### Changed: Memory Scope Defaults

`@mastra/memory` - `0.16.0`
`@mastra/core` - `0.22.0`

The default memory scope for both **working memory** and **semantic recall** has changed from `'thread'` to `'resource'`.

**Before:**

- Working memory defaulted to `scope: 'thread'` (isolated per conversation)
- Semantic recall defaulted to `scope: 'thread'` (search within current conversation only)

**After:**

- Working memory defaults to `scope: 'resource'` (persists across all user conversations)
- Semantic recall defaults to `scope: 'resource'` (search across all user conversations)

**Why this change?**

1. **Better user experience**: Most applications want to remember user information across conversations, not just within a single thread
2. **More intuitive default**: Users expect AI agents to "remember" them, which requires resource-scoped memory
3. **Alignment with common use cases**: The majority of production applications use resource-scoped memory

**Migration:**

If you want to maintain the old behavior where memory is isolated per conversation thread, explicitly set `scope: 'thread'` in your memory configuration:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

const memory = new Memory({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: "file:local.db" }),
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      scope: "thread", // Explicitly set to thread-scoped
      template: `# User Profile
- **Name**:
- **Interests**:
`,
    },
    semanticRecall: {
      topK: 3,
      scope: "thread", // Explicitly set to thread-scoped
    },
  },
});
```

If you want to adopt the new default behavior, you can optionally remove explicit `scope: 'resource'` declarations as they're now redundant.

### Deprecated: `format: "aisdk"`

The `format: "aisdk"` option in `stream()`/`generate()` methods is deprecated. Use the `@mastra/ai-sdk` package instead. Learn more in the [Using Vercel AI SDK documentation](/docs/v0/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk).

### Removed: MCP Classes

`@mastra/mcp` - `0.14.0`

- Removed `MastraMCPClient` class. Use [`MCPClient`](/reference/v0/tools/mcp-client) class instead.
- Removed `MCPConfigurationOptions` type. Use [`MCPClientOptions`](/reference/v0/tools/mcp-client#mcpclientoptions) type instead. The API is identical.
- Removed `MCPConfiguration` class. Use [`MCPClient`](/reference/v0/tools/mcp-client) class instead.

### Removed: CLI flags & commands

`mastra` - `0.17.0`

- Removed the `mastra deploy` CLI command. Use the deploy instructions of your individual platform.
- Removed `--env` flag from `mastra build` command. To start the build output with a custom env use `mastra start --env <env>` instead.
- Remove `--port` flag from `mastra dev`. Use `server.port` on the `new Mastra()` class instead.

## Migrate to v0.21
