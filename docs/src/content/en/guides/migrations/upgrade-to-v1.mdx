# Upgrade to Mastra v1

In this guide you'll learn how to upgrade through breaking changes in pre-v1 versions of Mastra. It'll also help you upgrade to Mastra v1.

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time.

<Callout type="info">

Versions mentioned in the headings refer to the `@mastra/core` package. If necessary, versions of other Mastra packages are called out in the detailed description.

All Mastra packages have a peer dependency on `@mastra/core` so once you upgrade it, your package manager is able to tell you the correct package versions for the rest of Mastra.

## Migrate to v0.22

### Deprecated: `format: "aisdk"`

The `format: "aisdk"` option in `stream()`/`generate()` methods is deprecated. Use the `@mastra/ai-sdk` package instead. Learn more in the [Using Vercel AI SDK documentation](../../docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk.mdx).

### Removed: MCP Classes

- Removed `MastraMCPClient` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx) class instead.
- Removed `MCPConfigurationOptions` type. Use [`MCPClientOptions`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx#mcpclientoptions) type instead. The API is identical.
- Removed `MCPConfiguration` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.mdx) class instead.

### Removed: CLI flags & commands

- Removed the `mastra deploy` CLI command. Use the deploy instructions of your individual platform.
- Removed `--env` flag from `mastra build` command. To start the build output with a custom env use `mastra start --env <env>` instead.
