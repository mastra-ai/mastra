# Deploy Mastra to Cloudflare

Use `@mastra/deployer-cloudflare` to deploy your Mastra server to Cloudflare Workers. The deployer bundles your code and generates a `wrangler.jsonc` file conforming to Cloudflare's [wrangler configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/), ready to deploy with no additional configuration.

:::info

If you're using a [server adapter](/docs/server/server-adapters) or [web framework](/docs/deployment/web-framework), deploy the way you normally would for that framework.

:::

## Before you begin

You'll need a [Mastra application](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) and a [Cloudflare](https://cloudflare.com/) account.

Cloudflare Workers use an ephemeral filesystem, so any storage you configure (including observability storage) must be hosted externally. If you're using [LibSQLStore](/reference/storage/libsql) with a file URL, switch to a remotely hosted database.

## Installation

Add the `@mastra/deployer-cloudflare` package to your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/deployer-cloudflare@latest
```

Import [`CloudflareDeployer`](/reference/deployer/cloudflare) and set it as the deployer in your Mastra configuration:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
// highlight-next-line
import { CloudflareDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-cloudflare";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // highlight-start
  deployer: new CloudflareDeployer({
    name: "your-project-name",
    vars: {
      NODE_ENV: "production",
    },
  }),
  // highlight-end
});
```

## Manual deployment

Manual deployments are also possible using the [Cloudflare Wrangler CLI](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/). With the Wrangler CLI installed run the following from your project root to deploy your application.

With the Wrangler CLI installed, login and authenticate with your Cloudflare logins:

```bash
npx wrangler login
```

Run the following to build and deploy your application to Cloudflare

```bash
npm run build && wrangler deploy --config .mastra/output/wrangler.json
```

> You can also run `wrangler dev --config .mastra/output/wrangler.json` from your project root to test your Mastra application locally.
