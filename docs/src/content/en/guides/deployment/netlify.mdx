# Deploy Mastra to Netlify

In this guide, you'll learn how to deploy a Mastra application with Netlify using `@mastra/deployer-netlify`. The deployer handles packaging, configuration, and deployment by adapting Mastra's output to create an optimized version of your server. At the end you'll have a Mastra application running on Netlify Functions.

## Before you begin

- You'll need an existing Mastra application. If you don't have one yet, follow the [Getting Started guide](/guides/getting-started/quickstart) to create a simple Mastra app.
- A Netlify account. If you don't have one, sign up at [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/).
- Remove any usage of [LibSQLStore](/reference/storage/libsql) with file URLs from your Mastra configuration. Use in-memory storage (`:memory:`) or external storage providers like Turso, PostgreSQL, or Upstash. Netlify Functions use an ephemeral filesystem and cannot persist files.

:::info

You can use and deploy Mastra in different ways: Using its [standalone server](/docs/server/mastra-server), using a [server adapter](/docs/server/server-adapters), or by integrating it with a [web framework](/docs/deployment/web-framework).

This guide assumes you're using the **standalone server** approach. For the other two options, refer to guides that the respective frameworks provide.

:::

## Installation

Add the `@mastra/deployer-netlify` package to your project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify@latest
```

Afterwards, import [`NetlifyDeployer`](/reference/deployer/netlify) and set it as the deployer in your Mastra configuration:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
// highlight-next-line
import { NetlifyDeployer } from "@mastra/deployer-netlify";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // highlight-next-line
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer(),
});
```

Lastly, create a `netlify.toml` file with the following contents in your project root:

```toml
[build]
  command = "mastra build"
```

## Usage

After setting up your project, push it to your remote Git provider of choice (e.g. GitHub).

<Steps>
<StepItem>

Connect your repository to Netlify. During the setup process, Netlify will detect your `netlify.toml` file and set the build command to `mastra build`.

:::warning

Do not forget to set your environment variables needed to run your application (e.g. `OPENAI_API_KEY` if you're using OpenAI as the LLM provider).

Once you're ready, click the **"Deploy"** button and wait for the first deployment to complete. It'll tell you that one function has been deployed.

</StepItem>
<StepItem>

Try out your newly deployed function by going to `https://<random-slug>.netlify.app/api/agents`. You should get a JSON response listing all available agents.

Since the [Mastra server](/docs/server/mastra-server) prefixes every API endpoint with `/api`, you have to add it to your URLs when making requests.

:::info

Netlify functions are typically deployed at `https://<random-slug>.netlify.app/.netlify/functions/api`. The `NetlifyDeployer` redirects any request to `/.netlify/functions/api/:splat` to the root `/*`.
