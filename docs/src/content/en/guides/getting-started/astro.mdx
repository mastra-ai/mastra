# Integrate Mastra in your Astro project

In this guide, you'll build a tool-calling AI agent using Mastra, then connect it to Astro by importing and calling the agent directly from your routes.

You'll use Astro without any third-party integrations to display a simple chat interface. After successfully completing this guide, you can explore [next steps](#next-steps) to enhance your app further.

## Before you begin

- You'll need an API key from a supported [model provider](/models/v1). If you don't have a preference, use [OpenAI](/models/v1/providers/openai).
- Install Node.js `v22.13.0` or later
