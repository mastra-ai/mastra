# Standalone Server Quickstart

In this quickstart, you'll build an AI agent with tool-calling capabilities using Mastra, then run it in [Studio](/docs/v1/getting-started/studio), Mastra's interactive development environment. 

This is the quickest way to build your first agent with Mastra.

You'll use `create mastra` to set up your project with example agents, workflows, and tools, which you can then learn from or adapt.

In _about_ 2 minutes, you'll have a functional AI-powered app ready to extend with your own tools and logic.

## Before you begin

* You'll need an API key from a supported [model provider](/models/v1). If you don't have a preference, use [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys).

## Install with `create mastra`

You can run `create mastra` anywhere on your machine.

When prompted, choose a provider (e.g. OpenAI) and enter your key:

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm">

```bash copy
npm create mastra@beta
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash copy
pnpm create mastra@beta
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash copy
yarn create mastra@beta
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="bun" label="bun">

```bash copy
bun create mastra@beta
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

This creates a new directory for your project with a `src/mastra` folder containing an example weather agent and the following files:

- `index.ts` - Mastra config, including memory
- `tools/weather-tool.ts` - a tool to fetch weather for a given location
- `agents/weather-agent.ts` - a weather agent with a prompt that uses the tool

:::note

You can use [flags](/reference/v1/create-mastra) with `create mastra` like `--no-example` to skip the example weather agent or `--template` to start from a specific [template](/docs/v1/getting-started/templates).

:::

## Test your agent

1. Once setup is complete, follow the instructions in your terminal to start the Mastra development server

2. Open Studio at http://localhost:4111

3. Try asking about the weather. If your API key is set up correctly, you'll get a response

[Studio](/docs/v1/getting-started/studio) lets you rapidly build and prototype agents without needing to build a UI. Once you're ready, you can integrate your Mastra agent into your application using the guides below.

## Next steps

- Integrate Mastra with your frontend framework: [Next.js](/docs/v1/frameworks/web-frameworks/next-js), [React](/docs/v1/frameworks/web-frameworks/vite-react), or [Astro](/docs/v1/frameworks/web-frameworks/astro).
- Read more about [Mastra's features](/docs/v1#why-mastra).
- Build an agent from scratch following one of our [guides](/guides/v1).
- Watch conceptual guides on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mastra-ai) and [subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/@mastra-ai?sub_confirmation=1)!
