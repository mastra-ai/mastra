# Contributing Templates

The Mastra community plays a vital role in creating templates that showcase innovative application patterns. We're currently reworking our template contribution process to ensure high-quality, valuable templates for the community. For the time being, we're not accepting new template contributions. Please keep an eye on this page for updates on when contributions will reopen and the new submission process.
