# Observability Overview

Mastra provides comprehensive observability features designed specifically for AI applications. Monitor LLM operations, trace agent decisions, and debug complex workflows with specialized tools that understand AI-specific patterns.

## Key Features

### Tracing

Specialized tracing for AI operations that captures:

- **Model interactions**: Token usage, latency, prompts, and completions
- **Agent execution**: Decision paths, tool calls, and memory operations
- **Workflow steps**: Branching logic, parallel execution, and step outputs
- **Automatic instrumentation**: Zero-configuration tracing with decorators

## Quick Start

Configure Observability in your Mastra instance:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";
import {
  Observability,
  DefaultExporter,
  CloudExporter,
  SensitiveDataFilter,
} from "@mastra/observability";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  logger: new PinoLogger(),
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    id: 'mastra-storage',
    url: "file:./mastra.db", // Storage is required for tracing
  }),
  observability: new Observability({
    configs: {
      default: {
        serviceName: "mastra",
        exporters: [
          new DefaultExporter(), // Persists traces to configured storage for Mastra Studio (requires storage configuration, disabled without it)
          new CloudExporter(), // Sends traces to Mastra Cloud (if MASTRA_CLOUD_ACCESS_TOKEN is set)
        ],
        spanOutputProcessors: [
          new SensitiveDataFilter(), // Redacts sensitive data like passwords, tokens, keys
        ],
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

With this basic setup, you will see Traces and Logs in both Studio and in Mastra Cloud.

We also support various external tracing providers like MLflow, Langfuse, Braintrust, and any OpenTelemetry-compatible platform (Datadog, New Relic, SigNoz, etc.). See more about this in the [Tracing](/docs/v1/observability/tracing/overview) documentation.
