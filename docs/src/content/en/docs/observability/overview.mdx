# Observability Overview

Mastra provides comprehensive observability features designed specifically for AI applications. Monitor LLM operations, trace agent decisions, and debug complex workflows with specialized tools that understand AI-specific patterns.

## Key Features

### Tracing

Specialized tracing for AI operations that captures:

- **Model interactions**: Token usage, latency, prompts, and completions
- **Agent execution**: Decision paths, tool calls, and memory operations
- **Workflow steps**: Branching logic, parallel execution, and step outputs
- **Automatic instrumentation**: Zero-configuration tracing with decorators

## Quick Start

Configure Observability in your Mastra instance:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PinoLogger } from "@mastra/loggers";
import { LibSqlStorage } from "@mastra/libsql";
import { Observability } from "@mastra/observability";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ... other config
  logger: new PinoLogger(),
  storage: new LibSQLStore({
    id: 'mastra-storage',
    url: "file:./mastra.db", // Storage is required for tracing
  }),
  observability: new Observability({ // Enables Tracing
    default: { enabled: true },
  }),
});
```

With this basic setup, you will see Traces and Logs in both Studio and in Mastra Cloud.

We also support various external tracing providers like Langfuse, Braintrust, and any OpenTelemetry-compatible platform (Datadog, New Relic, SigNoz, etc.). See more about this in the [Tracing](/docs/v1/observability/tracing/overview) documentation.
