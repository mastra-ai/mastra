# Dynamic Tool Context

Mastra provides `RuntimeContext`, a system based on dependency injection, that allows you to pass dynamic, request-specific configuration to your tools during execution. This is useful when a tool's behavior needs to change based on user identity, request headers, or other runtime factors, without altering the tool's core code.

## Overview

Using `RuntimeContext` allows you to:

1.  Define a type-safe structure for your dynamic configuration.
2.  Pass runtime variables to agents and tools via the `runtimeContext` option in `generate()` or `stream()` calls.
3.  Access these variables within the `execute` function of your tools.
4.  Modify tool behavior based on runtime data (e.g., user preferences, location).
5.  Share configuration across multiple tools used within the same agent call.

  **Note:** `RuntimeContext` is primarily used for passing data *into* tool executions. It's distinct from agent memory, which handles conversation history and state persistence across multiple calls.
</Callout>

## Basic Usage

1.  **Define the Context Type:** Create a type definition for the data you want to pass.
2.  **Instantiate `RuntimeContext`:** Create an instance typed with your definition.
3.  **Set Values:** Populate the context with data.
4.  **Pass to Agent:** Include the `runtimeContext` instance in the options object when calling `agent.generate()` or `agent.stream()`.

```typescript
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
// Assume 'agent' is an already defined Mastra Agent instance

// 1. Define the context type
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
};

// 2. Instantiate RuntimeContext
const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext<WeatherRuntimeContext>();

// 3. Set values
runtimeContext.set("temperature-scale", "celsius");

// 4. Pass to agent call
const response = await agent.generate("What's the weather like today?", {
  runtimeContext, // Pass the context here
});

console.log(response.text);
```

## Accessing Context in Tools

Tools receive the `runtimeContext` as part of the second argument to their `execute` function. You can then use the `.get()` method to retrieve values.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";
// Assume WeatherRuntimeContext is defined as above and accessible here

// Dummy fetch function
async function fetchWeather(
  location: string,
  options: { temperatureUnit: "celsius" | "fahrenheit" }
): Promise<any> {
  console.log(`Fetching weather for ${location} in ${options.temperatureUnit}`);
  // Replace with actual API call
  return { temperature: options.temperatureUnit === "celsius" ? 20 : 68 };
}

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "getWeather",
  description: "Get the current weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string().describe("The location to get weather for"),
  }),
  // The tool's execute function receives runtimeContext
  execute: async ({ context, runtimeContext }) => {
    // Type-safe access to runtimeContext variables
    const temperatureUnit = runtimeContext.get("temperature-scale");

    // Use the context value in the tool logic
    const weather = await fetchWeather(context.location, {
      temperatureUnit,
    });

    return { result: `The temperature is ${weather.temperature}Â°${temperatureUnit === "celsius" ? "C" : "F"}` };
  },
});
```

When the agent uses `weatherTool`, the `temperature-scale` value set in the `runtimeContext` during the `agent.generate()` call will be available inside the tool's `execute` function.

## Using with Server Middleware

In server environments (like Express or Next.js), you can use middleware to automatically populate `RuntimeContext` based on incoming request data, such as headers or user sessions.

Here's an example using Mastra's built-in server middleware support (which uses Hono internally) to set the temperature scale based on the Cloudflare `CF-IPCountry` header:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weather"; // Assume agent is defined elsewhere

// Define RuntimeContext type
type WeatherRuntimeContext = {
  "temperature-scale": "celsius" | "fahrenheit";
};

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: {
    weather: weatherAgent,
  },
  server: {
    middleware: [
      async (c, next) => {
        // Get the RuntimeContext instance (Mastra provides one by default)
        const runtimeContext = c.get<RuntimeContext<WeatherRuntimeContext>>("runtimeContext");

        // Get country code from request header
        const country = c.req.header("CF-IPCountry");

        // Set temperature scale based on country
        runtimeContext.set(
          "temperature-scale",
          country === "US" ? "fahrenheit" : "celsius",
        );

        // Continue request processing
        await next();
      },
    ],
  },
});
```

With this middleware in place, any agent call handled by this Mastra server instance will automatically have the `temperature-scale` set in its `RuntimeContext` based on the user's inferred country, and tools like `weatherTool` will use it accordingly.
