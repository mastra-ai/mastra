# Quickstart

Choose how you want to get started with Mastra:

<CardGrid columns={2}>
  <CardGridItem
    title="Standalone Server (Recommended)"
    href="/guides/v1/quickstarts/standalone-server"
  >
    The fastest way to get started - spin up a standalone Mastra server and interact with your agents in Studio
  </CardGridItem>
  <CardGridItem
    title="Next.js"
    href="/guides/v1/quickstarts/nextjs"
  >
    Integrate Mastra into a Next.js app and use the AI SDK UI to build an in‑app chat interface for your agents
  </CardGridItem>
</CardGrid>

For more control over setup, or to add Mastra to an existing project, see the [manual installation guide](/docs/v1/getting-started/installation). You can also use [`mastra init`](/reference/v1/cli/mastra#mastra-init) for existing projects.
