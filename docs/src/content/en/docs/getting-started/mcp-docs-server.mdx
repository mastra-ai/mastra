# Mastra Docs Server

The `@mastra/mcp-docs-server` package provides direct access to Mastra’s full knowledge base, including documentation, code examples, blog posts, and changelogs, via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/getting-started/intro). It works with Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, Claude Code, Codex or any tool that supports MCP.

These tools are designed to help agents retrieve precise, task-specific information — whether you're adding a feature to an agent, scaffolding a new project, or exploring how something works.

In this guide you'll learn how to add Mastra's MCP server to your AI tooling.

## Installation

### create-mastra

During the interactive [create-mastra](/reference/v1/cli/create-mastra) wizard, choose one of your tools in the MCP step.

### Manual setup

If there are no specific instructions for your tool below, you may be able to add the MCP server with this common JSON configuration anyways.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastra": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@beta"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Claude Code CLI

Install using the terminal command:

```bash
claude mcp add mastra -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server@beta
```

### OpenAI Codex CLI

1. Register it from the terminal:

   ```bash copy
   codex mcp add mastra-docs -- npx -y @mastra/mcp-docs-server@beta
   ```

2. Run `codex mcp list` to confirm the server shows as `enabled`.

### Cursor

Install by clicking the button below:

[![Install MCP Server](https://cursor.com/deeplink/mcp-install-light.svg)](cursor://anysphere.cursor-deeplink/mcp/install?name=mastra&config=eyJjb21tYW5kIjoibnB4IC15IEBtYXN0cmEvbWNwLWRvY3Mtc2VydmVyIn0%3D)

If you followed the automatic installation, you'll see a popup when you open cursor in the bottom left corner to prompt you to enable the Mastra Docs MCP Server.

### Antigravity

Google Antigravity is an agent-first development platform that supports MCP servers for accessing external documentation, APIs, and project context.

1. Open your Antigravity MCP configuration file:
   - Click on **Agent session** and select the **“…” dropdown** at the top of the editor’s side panel, then select **MCP Servers** to access the **MCP Store**.
   - You can access it through the MCP Store interface in Antigravity

<img
  src="/img/antigravity_mcp_server.png"
  alt="Antigravity interface showing configured Mastra MCP server"
  width={800}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

2. To add a custom MCP server, select **Manage MCP Servers** at the top of the MCP Store and click **View raw config** in the main tab.

<img
  src="/img/antigravity_managed_mcp.png"
  alt="Antigravity Manage MCP Servers dialog with View raw config option"
  width={800}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

3. Add the Mastra MCP server configuration:

   ```json copy
   {
      "mcpServers": {
          "mastra-docs": {
              "command": "npx",
              "args": [
                  "-y",
                  "@mastra/mcp-docs-server"
              ]
          }
      }
    }
   ```

4. Save the configuration and restart Antigravity

<img
  src="/img/antigravity_final_interface_mcp.png"
  alt="Antigravity interface showing configured Mastra MCP server"
  width={800}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

Once configured, the Mastra MCP server exposes the following to Antigravity agents:
- Indexed documentation and API schemas for Mastra, enabling programmatic retrieval of relevant context during code generation
- Access to example code snippets and usage patterns stored in Mastra Docs
- Structured data for error handling and debugging references in the editor
- Metadata about current Mastra project patterns for code suggestion and completion

The MCP server will appear in Antigravity's MCP Store, where you can manage its connection status and authentication if needed.

### Visual Studio Code

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your workspace
2. Insert the following configuration:

   ```json copy
   {
     "servers": {
       "mastra": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@beta"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

Once you installed the MCP server, you can use it like so:

1. Open VSCode settings.
2. Navigate to MCP settings.
3. Click "enable" on the Chat > MCP option.

<img
  src="/img/vscode-mcp-setting.png"
  alt="Settings page of VSCode to enable MCP"
  width={800}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

MCP only works in Agent mode in VSCode. Once you are in agent mode, open the `mcp.json` file and click the "start" button. Note that the "start" button will only appear if the `.vscode` folder containing `mcp.json` is in your workspace root, or the highest level of the in-editor file explorer.

<img
  src="/img/vscode-start-mcp.png"
  alt="Settings page of VSCode to enable MCP"
  width={800}
  className="rounded-lg"
/>

After starting the MCP server, click the tools button in the Copilot pane to see available tools.

### Windsurf

1. Open `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` in your editor
2. Insert the following configuration:

   ```json copy
   {
     "mcpServers": {
       "mastra": {
         "command": "npx",
         "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@beta"]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

3. Save the configuration and restart Windsurf

## Usage

Once configured, you can ask your AI tool questions about Mastra or instruct it to take actions. For these steps, it'll take the up-to-date information from Mastra's MCP server.

**Add features:**

- "Add evals to my agent and write tests"
- "Write me a workflow that does the following `[task]`"
- "Make a new tool that allows my agent to access `[3rd party API]`"

**Ask about integrations:**

- "Does Mastra work with the AI SDK?
  How can I use it in my `[React/Svelte/etc]` project?"
- "What's the latest Mastra news around MCP?"
- "Does Mastra support `[provider]` speech and voice APIs? Show me an example in my code of how I can use it."

**Debug or update existing code:**

- "I'm running into a bug with agent memory, have there been any related changes or bug fixes recently?"
- "How does working memory behave in Mastra and how can I use it to do `[task]`? It doesn't seem to work the way I expect."
- "I saw there are new workflow features, explain them to me and then update `[workflow]` to use them."

### Troubleshooting

1. **Server Not Starting**
   - Ensure [npx](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v11/commands/npx) is installed and working.
   - Check for conflicting MCP servers.
   - Verify your configuration file syntax.

2. **Tool Calls Failing**
   - Restart the MCP server and/or your IDE.
   - Update to the latest version of your IDE.
