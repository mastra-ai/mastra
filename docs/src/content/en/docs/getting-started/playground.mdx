# Playground

Playground gives you an interactive UI for building and testing agents, as well as a REST API that exposes your Mastra application as a local service.

It's perfect at the start of a project when you want to prototype your agent before thinking about integration. As your project evolves, Playground lets you view traces, run scorers, and iterate quickly as you extend your agent's capabilities.

Run Playground locally using the instructions below, or [deploy your agent to Mastra Cloud](/docs/mastra-cloud/setting-up) to access the Playground remotely and share access with your team.

## Launch Playground

If you created your application with `create mastra`, start the local development server using the `dev` script. You can also run it directly with `mastra dev`.

<Tabs items={["npm", "pnpm", "yarn", "bun", "mastra dev"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    mastra dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

By default, Playground starts on port 4111. Once it's running, you can:

- Open the Playground UI at http://localhost:4111/ to test your agents interactively.
- Visit the Swagger UI at http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui to discover and interact with the REST API.

## Playground UI

The Playground UI allows you to interact with your agents, workflows, and tools, observe exactly what happens under the hood with each interaction, and tweak things as you go. 

### Agents


Chat with your agents directly, dynamically switch between [model providers](/models), and tweak model settings like temperature and top-p to understand how they affect your agent's output.

/>

When you interact with your agents, you can follow each step of their reasoning, view tool call outputs, and [observe traces and logs](#observability) to see how responses are generated. You can also attach [scorers](#scorers) to measure and compare response quality over time.

### Workflows

Visualize your workflow as a graph and run it step by step with a custom input. During execution, the interface updates in real time to show the active step and the path taken.

/>

When running a workflow, you can also view detailed traces showing tool calls, raw JSON outputs, and any errors that might have occured along the way.

### Tools

Run tools in isolation to see how they respond. It's a quick way to test tools before giving them to your agent, or isolate them to debug should something go wrong.

### MCP
List the MCP servers attached to your Mastra instance, explore the tools they expose, and see how those tools are used by your agents.

### Observability

Playground includes built-in observability powered by AI Tracing, giving you a clear view of what happens inside your agents, workflows, and tools.

![](https://mastra.ai/_next/image?url=%2Ftracingafter.png&w=1920&q=75)

When you run an agent or workflow, the Observability tab displays traces that highlight the key AI operations such as model calls, tool executions, and workflow steps. You can follow these traces in real time to see how data moves, where time is spent, and what's happening under the hood. AI Tracing filters out low-level framework details so your traces stay focused and readable.


### Scorers

Test and validate your scoring functions within the Playground environment. Run evaluations against your agents to measure performance metrics, test different scoring criteria, and ensure your agents meet quality standards. The scoring interface helps you understand how well your agents perform across various test cases and identify areas for improvement.

## API Endpoints

The local development server exposes a complete set of REST API routes, allowing you to programmatically interact with your agents, workflows, and tools during development.

You can explore all available endpoints by accessing the OpenAPI specification at `http://localhost:4111/openapi.json`, which provides detailed documentation of request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and available operations. 

For an interactive API exploration experience, visit the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui`, where you can test endpoints directly from your browser with live request/response examples. 

## Configuration

### Port

By default, the development server runs on port 4111, but you can customize both the host and port through the Mastra server configuration: 

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: "0.0.0.0",
  },
});
```

### Local HTTPS

Mastra supports local HTTPS development through the `--https` flag, which automatically creates and manages certificates for your project. When you run `mastra dev --https`, a private key and certificate are generated for localhost (or your configured host). For custom certificate management, you can provide your own key and certificate files through the server configuration:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import fs from 'node:fs';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert.pem')
    }
  },
});
```
When both the `--https` flag and `server.https` configuration are provided, the configuration takes precedence.

### Bundling

Use `transpilePackages` to compile TypeScript packages or libraries that need transformation. The `externals` option excludes dependencies that should be resolved at runtime rather than bundled. Enable `sourcemap` to generate readable stack traces for better debugging:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  bundler: {
    transpilePackages: ["utils"],
    externals: ["ui"],
    sourcemap: true
  }
});
```
