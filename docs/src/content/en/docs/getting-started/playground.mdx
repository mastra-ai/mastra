# Playground

The Mastra Playground is a local development server that lets you build, test, and refine your AI agents without needing to set up a frontend or deployment environment. It's useful both at the start of a project - when you're exploring ideas and defining agent behavior - and later, when you want to tweak model settings, review traces, or debug agent behaviour.

Playground includes two main components - the [Playground UI](#testing-your-mastra-components), an interactive interface for developing, testing, and visualizing your agents, and a [REST API](#api-endpoints), which exposes your Mastra application as local services. This page introduces both components and shows how to use them in your local development workflow.

## Launch Playground

Start the local development server by running:
<Tabs items={["npm", "yarn", "pnpm", "bun", "Mastra CLI"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bun run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    mastra dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

By default, Playground will be launched on port 4111:

- Playground - [http://localhost:4111/](http://localhost:4111/)
- Swagger UI - API explorer - [http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui](http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui)

## Playground UI

In this section, we'll explore every feature of Mastra and what you can do in the Playground to test and debug each component during development.

### Agents

Quickly test and debug your agents during development using the interactive chat interface in the Agent Playground.

/>

Key features:

- Chat Interface - Talk to your agent and see how it responds in real time.
- Model Settings - Tweak settings like temperature and top-p to see how they affect output.
- Agent Endpoints - See the available REST API routes your agent exposes and how to use them.
- Traces
- Scorers (evals)

### Tools

Quickly test and debug custom tools in isolation using the Tools Playground, without running a full agent or workflow.

/>

Key features:

- Test Tools in Isolation - Try out individual tools on their own without running a full agent or workflow.
- Input & Responses - Send sample inputs to see how the tool responds.
- Tool Usage - Find out which agents rely on this tool and how they're using it.


### Workflows

Validate workflows by supplying defined inputs and visualizing each step within the Workflow Playground.

/>

Key features:

- Workflow Visualization - See your workflow as a visual graph so you can follow the steps and branches at a glance.
- Step Inputs & Outputs - Check the data going into and coming out of each step to see how everything flows.
- Run Workflows - Test your workflow with real inputs to validate the logic and debug any issues.
- Execution JSON - Get the full picture of a run as raw JSONâ€”inputs, outputs, errors, and results included.
- Workflow Traces - Dig into a detailed breakdown of each step, including data flow, tool calls, and any errors along the way.

### MCP

Explore connection details, tool usage, and IDE configuration for local MCP server development.

Key features:

- Connection Details - Access the endpoints and config needed to wire up your MCP environment.
- Available Tools - See all tools currently published, including their names, versions, and which agents use them.
- IDE Configuration - Grab ready-to-use config you can drop into your local setup for testing and publishing tools.

### Observability

The Playground includes comprehensive observability features to help you understand what's happening inside your Mastra application. Agent traces let you step through every decision, tool call, and response generation. Workflow traces provide detailed breakdowns of each step's execution including timing and data flow. You can examine errors, performance metrics, and system behavior to identify bottlenecks and debug issues effectively.

### Scorers

Test and validate your scoring functions within the Playground environment. Run evaluations against your agents to measure performance metrics, test different scoring criteria, and ensure your agents meet quality standards. The scoring interface helps you understand how well your agents perform across various test cases and identify areas for improvement.

## API Endpoints

The local development server exposes a complete set of REST API routes through the Mastra Server, allowing you to programmatically interact with your agents, workflows, and tools during development.

You can explore all available endpoints by accessing the OpenAPI specification at `http://localhost:4111/openapi.json`, which provides detailed documentation of request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and available operations. 

For an interactive API exploration experience, visit the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui`, where you can test endpoints directly from your browser with live request/response examples. 

## Configuration

### Port

By default, the development server runs on port 4111, but you can customize both the host and port through the Mastra server configuration: 

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: "0.0.0.0",
  },
});
```

### Local HTTPS

Mastra supports local HTTPS development through the `--https` flag, which automatically creates and manages certificates for your project. When you run `mastra dev --https`, a private key and certificate are generated for localhost (or your configured host). For custom certificate management, you can provide your own key and certificate files through the server configuration:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import fs from 'node:fs';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    https: {
      key: fs.readFileSync('path/to/key.pem'),
      cert: fs.readFileSync('path/to/cert.pem')
    }
  },
});
```

When both the `--https` flag and `server.https` configuration are provided, the configuration takes precedence.

### Bundler Options

Configure the bundler to handle TypeScript packages, manage external dependencies, and control source map generation. Use `transpilePackages` to compile TypeScript packages or libraries that need transformation. The `externals` option excludes dependencies that should be resolved at runtime rather than bundled. Enable `sourcemap` to generate readable stack traces for better debugging:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  bundler: {
    transpilePackages: ["utils"],
    externals: ["ui"],
    sourcemap: true
  }
});
```
