# Mastra Overview

To use Mastra, you need access to a large language model (LLM). By default, Mastra is configured to work with [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/), and you'll need an API key to get started.

Mastra also supports other LLM providers. For details on compatible providers and how to configure them, see [Model Providers](/docs/getting-started/model-providers).

Mastra can be installed as a standalone project or integrated with an existing project. Choose from the following to get started

- [Automatic Install](/docs/getting-started/installation)
- [Manual Install](/docs/getting-started/manual-installation)
- [Add Mastra to an Existing Project](/docs/getting-started/existing-install)


## What You'll Build

By following one of our installation guides, you'll build a Weather Agent that generates weather reports using OpenAI's [gpt-4o-mini](https://platform.openai.com/docs/models/gpt-4o-mini) and the Open-Meteo [forecast](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs#api_documentation) endpoint. You can run it directly from the command line or test it in the Mastra Playground. With the Weather agent running you can ask questions like:

> What is the weather in London? <br/>
> Suggest indoor alternatives in Berlin if it rains tomorrow. <br />
> Is it windy in San Francisco today?
