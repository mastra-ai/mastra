# Add Mastra to an Existing Project

Mastra can be installed and integrated into a wide range of projects. Below are links to integration guides to help you get started:

- [Next.js](/docs/frameworks/web-frameworks/next-js)
- [Vite + React](/docs/frameworks/web-frameworks/vite-react)
- [Astro](/docs/frameworks/web-frameworks/astro)
- [Express](/docs/frameworks/servers/express)


## Mastra init

When adding Mastra to an existing project, youâ€™ll typically use `mastra init` instead of `create-mastra`. Learn more about both commands here:

- [mastra init](/reference/cli/init)
- [create-mastra](/reference/cli/create-mastra)
