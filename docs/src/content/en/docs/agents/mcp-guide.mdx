# Using MCP With Mastra

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with external tools and resources.

## Overview

MCP in Mastra provides a standardized way to connect to tool servers and supports both stdio and SSE-based connections.

## Installation

Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/mcp@latest
```

Using npm:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/mcp@latest
```

## Using MCP in Your Code

The `MCPConfiguration` class provides a way to manage multiple tool servers in your Mastra applications without managing multiple MCP clients. You can configure both stdio-based and SSE-based servers:

```typescript
import { MCPConfiguration } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    // stdio example
    sequential: {
      name: "sequential-thinking",
      server: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      },
    },
    // SSE example
    weather: {
      url: new URL("http://localhost:8080/sse"),
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Tools vs Toolsets

The `MCPConfiguration` class provides two ways to access MCP tools, each suited for different use cases:

#### Using Tools (`getTools()`)

Use this approach when:

- You have a single MCP connection
- The tools are used by a single user/context
- Tool configuration (API keys, credentials) remains constant
- You want to initialize an Agent with a fixed set of tools

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "CLI Assistant",
  instructions: "You help users with CLI tasks",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(), // Tools are fixed at agent creation
});
```

#### Using Toolsets (`getToolsets()`)

Use this approach when:

- You need per-request tool configuration
- Tools need different credentials per user
- Running in a multi-user environment (web app, API, etc)
- Tool configuration needs to change dynamically

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    example: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["-y", "@example/fakemcp"],
      env: {
        API_KEY: "your-api-key",
      },
    },
  },
});

// Get the current toolsets configured for this user
const toolsets = await mcp.getToolsets();

// Use the agent with user-specific tool configurations
const response = await agent.stream(
  "What's new in Mastra and how's the weather?",
  {
    toolsets,
  },
);
```

## MCP Registries

MCP servers can be accessed through registries that provide curated collections of tools.
We've curated an [MCP Registry Registry](https://mastra.ai/mcp-registry-registry) to help you find the best places to source MCP servers, but here's how you can use tools from some of our favorites:

### mcp.run Registry

[mcp.run](https://www.mcp.run/) makes it easy for you to call pre-authenticated, secure MCP Servers. The tools from mcp.run are free, and entirely managed, so your agent only needs a SSE URL and can use any tools a user has installed. MCP Servers are grouped into [Profiles](https://docs.mcp.run/user-guide/manage-profiles), and accessed with a unique SSE URL.

For each Profile, you can copy/paste unique, signed URLs into your `MCPConfiguration` like this:

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    marketing: {
      url: new URL(process.env.MCP_RUN_SSE_URL!),
    },
  },
});
```

> Important: Each SSE URL on on [mcp.run](https://mcp.run) contains a unique signature, that should be treated like a password. It's best to read your SSE URL as an environment variable and manage it outside of your application code.

```bash filename=".env" copy
MCP_RUN_SSE_URL=https://www.mcp.run/api/mcp/sse?nonce=...
```

### Composio.dev Registry

[Composio.dev](https://composio.dev) provides a registry of [SSE-based MCP servers](https://mcp.composio.dev) that can be easily integrated with Mastra. The SSE URL that's generated for Cursor is compatible with Mastra - you can use it directly in your configuration:

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    googleSheets: {
      url: new URL("https://mcp.composio.dev/googlesheets/[private-url-path]"),
    },
    gmail: {
      url: new URL("https://mcp.composio.dev/gmail/[private-url-path]"),
    },
  },
});
```

When using Composio-provided tools, you can authenticate with services (like Google Sheets or Gmail) directly through conversation with your agent. The tools include authentication capabilities that guide you through the process while chatting.

Note: The Composio.dev integration is best suited for single-user scenarios like personal automation, as the SSE URL is tied to your account and can't be used for multiple users. Each URL represents a single account's authentication context.

### Smithery.ai Registry

[Smithery.ai](https://smithery.ai) provides a registry of MCP servers that you can easily use with Mastra:

```typescript
// Unix/Mac
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    sequentialThinking: {
      command: "npx",
      args: [
        "-y",
        "@smithery/cli@latest",
        "run",
        "@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking",
        "--config",
        "{}",
      ],
    },
  },
});

// Windows
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    sequentialThinking: {
      command: "cmd",
      args: [
        "/c",
        "npx",
        "-y",
        "@smithery/cli@latest",
        "run",
        "@smithery-ai/server-sequential-thinking",
        "--config",
        "{}",
      ],
    },
  },
});
```

This example is adapted from the Claude integration example in the Smithery documentation.

## Excluding Tools in Your MCP Server

The tools from your MCP server are returned as a plain JavaScript object when you call `await mcp.getTools()` or `await mcp.getToolsets()`. This means you can easily filter or exclude tools before passing them to your agent.

### Excluding Tools Examples

Suppose your MCP server exposes three tools: `weather`, `stockPrice`, and `news`, but you want to exclude the `news` tool from your agent. You can do this by filtering the tools object:

```typescript
import { MCPConfiguration } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    myServer: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["tsx", "my-mcp-server.ts"],
    },
  },
});

// Get all tools from the MCP server
const allTools = await mcp.getTools();

// Exclude the 'news' tool (tool names are namespaced as 'serverName_toolName')
const filteredTools = Object.fromEntries(
  Object.entries(allTools).filter(([toolName]) => toolName !== "myServer_news")
);

// Pass only the filtered tools to your agent
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Selective Agent",
  instructions: "You can access only selected tools.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: filteredTools,
});
```

You can use any logic in the `.filter()` function to exclude tools by name, type, or any other property. This approach works the same way for `getToolsets()` if you want to filter toolsets dynamically per request.

Another approach is to destructure the tools you want to use, or exclude the tools you do not want.

```typescript
// Remove the undesired tool from the destructed object
const { myServer_news, ...filteredTools } = await mcp.getTools();

// Pass only the filtered tools to your agent
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Selective Agent",
  instructions: "You can access only selected tools.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: filteredTools,
});
```

```typescript
// Select the desired tools from the destructed object
const { myServer_weather, myServer_stockPrice } = await mcp.getTools();

// Pass only the filtered tools to your agent
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "Selective Agent",
  instructions: "You can access only selected tools.",
  model: openai("gpt-4"),
  tools: { myServer_weather, myServer_stockPrice },
});
```
