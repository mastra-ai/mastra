# Using Agents

**Agents** are one of the core Mastra primitives. Agents use a language model to decide on a sequence of actions. They can call functions (known as _tools_). You can compose them with *workflows* (the other main Mastra primitive), either by giving an agent a workflow as a tool, or by running an agent from within a workflow.

Agents can run autonomously in a loop, run once, or take turns with a user. You can give short-term, long-term, and working memory of their user interactions. They can stream text or return structured output (ie, JSON). They can access third-party APIs, query knowledge bases, and so on.

Additionally, agents support dynamic configuration, allowing you to change their instructions, model, tools, and memory based on runtime context like user preferences, subscription tiers, or environment settings.

## 1. Creating an Agent

To create an agent in Mastra, you use the `Agent` class and define its properties:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/test-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

const testAgent = new Agent({
  name: "test-agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o")
});
```

**Note:** Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables, such as your OpenAI API key, in your `.env` file:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

Also, make sure you have the `@mastra/core` package installed:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/core@latest
```

All agent properties (instructions, model, tools, memory) can be configured dynamically using runtime context. See the [Dynamic Agents guide](./dynamic-agents.mdx) for examples of how to adapt agent behavior based on user context, subscription tiers, or other runtime variables.

### Registering the Agent

Register your agent with Mastra to enable logging and access to configured tools and integrations:

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { testAgent } from './agents/test-agent';

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  agents: { testAgent },
});
```

## 2. Generating and streaming text

### Generating text

Use the `.generate()` method to have your agent produce text responses:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const response = await testAgent.generate([
  { role: "user", content: "Hello, how can you assist me today?" },
]);

console.log("Agent:", response.text);
```

For more details about the generate method and its options, see the [generate reference documentation](/reference/agents/generate).

### Streaming responses

For more real-time responses, you can stream the agent's response:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const stream = await testAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." },
]);

console.log("Agent:");

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

For more details about streaming responses, see the [stream reference documentation](/reference/agents/stream).

## 3. Describing images

Agents can analyze and describe images by processing both the visual content and any text within them. To enable image analysis, pass an object with `type: 'image'` and the image URL in the content array. You can combine image content with text prompts to guide the agent's analysis.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
await testAgent.generate([
  {
    role: 'user',
    content: [
      {
        type: 'image',
        image: "https://example.com/images/test-image.jpg",
        mimeType: "image/jpeg"
      },
      {
        type: 'text',
        text: 'Describe the image in detail, and extract all the text in the image.',
      },
    ],
  },
]);
```

## 4. Structured Output

Agents can return structured data by providing a JSON Schema or using a Zod schema.

### Using JSON Schema

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const schema = {
  type: "object",
  properties: {
    summary: { type: "string" },
    keywords: { type: "array", items: { type: "string" } },
  },
  additionalProperties: false,
  required: ["summary", "keywords"],
};

const response = await testAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Zod

You can also use Zod schemas for type-safe structured outputs.

First, install Zod:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install zod
```

Then, define a Zod schema and use it with the agent:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { z } from "zod";

// Define the Zod schema
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

// Use the schema with the agent
const response = await testAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please provide a summary and keywords for the following text: ...",
    },
  ],
  {
    output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

### Using Tools

If you need to generate structured output alongside tool calls, you'll need to use the `experimental_output` property instead of `output`. Here's how:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const schema = z.object({
  summary: z.string(),
  keywords: z.array(z.string()),
});

const response = await testAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "Please analyze this repository and provide a summary and keywords...",
    },
  ],
  {
    // Use experimental_output to enable both structured output and tool calls
    experimental_output: schema,
  },
);

console.log("Structured Output:", response.object);
```

<br />

This allows you to have strong typing and validation for the structured data returned by the agent.

## 5. Multi-step tool use

Agents can be enhanced with tools - functions that extend their capabilities beyond text generation. Tools allow agents to perform calculations, access external systems, and process data. Agents not only decide whether to call tools they're given, they determine the parameters that should be given to that tool.

For a detailed guide to creating and configuring tools, see the [Adding Tools documentation](/docs/agents/using-tools-and-mcp), but below are the important things to know.

### Using `maxSteps`

The `maxSteps` parameter controls the maximum number of sequential LLM calls an agent can make, particularly important when using tool calls. By default, it is set to 1 to prevent infinite loops in case of misconfigured tools. You can increase this limit based on your use case:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const response = await testAgent.generate(
  [
    {
      role: "user",
      content:
        "If a taxi driver earns $41 per hour and works 12 hours a day, how much do they earn in one day?",
    },
  ],
  {
    maxSteps: 5, // Allow up to 5 tool usage steps
  },
);
```

### Streaming progress with `onStepFinish`

You can monitor the progress of multi-step operations using the `onStepFinish` callback. This is useful for debugging or providing progress updates to users.

`onStepFinish` is only available when streaming or generating text without structured output.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const response = await testAgent.generate(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onStepFinish: ({ text, toolCalls, toolResults }) => {
      console.log("Step completed:", { text, toolCalls, toolResults });
    },
  },
);
```

### Detecting completion with `onFinish`

The `onFinish` callback is available when streaming responses and provides detailed information about the completed interaction. It is called after the LLM has finished generating its response and all tool executions have completed.
This callback receives the final response text, execution steps, token usage statistics, and other metadata that can be useful for monitoring and logging:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const stream = await testAgent.stream(
  [{ role: "user", content: "Calculate the taxi driver's daily earnings." }],
  {
    maxSteps: 5,
    onFinish: ({
      steps,
      text,
      finishReason, // 'complete', 'length', 'tool', etc.
      usage, // token usage statistics
      reasoningDetails, // additional context about the agent's decisions
    }) => {
      console.log("Stream complete:", {
        totalSteps: steps.length,
        finishReason,
        usage,
      });
    },
  },
);
```

## 6. Testing agents locally

Mastra provides a CLI command `mastra dev` to run your agents behind an API. By default, this looks for exported agents in files in the `src/mastra/agents` directory. It generates endpoints for testing your agent (eg `http://localhost:4111/api/agents/myAgent/generate`) and provides a visual playground where you can chat with an agent and view traces.

For more details, see the [Local Dev Playground](/docs/server-db/local-dev-playground) docs.
