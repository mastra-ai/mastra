# Using Tools

Agents use tools to call APIs, query databases, or run custom functions from your codebase. Tools give agents capabilities beyond language generation by providing structured access to data and performing clearly defined operations. You can also load tools from remote [MCP servers](/docs/v1/mcp/overview) to expand an agent's capabilities.

## When to use tools

Use tools when an agent needs additional context or information from remote resources, or when it needs to run code that performs a specific operation. This includes tasks a model can't reliably handle on its own, such as fetching live data or returning consistent, well defined outputs.

## Creating a tool

When creating tools, keep descriptions simple and focused on what the tool does, emphasizing its primary use case. Descriptive schema names can also help guide the agent on how to use the tool.

This example shows how to create a tool that fetches weather data from an API. When the agent calls the tool, it provides the required input as defined by the tool's `inputSchema`. The tool accesses this data through its `inputData` parameter, which in this example includes the `location` used in the weather API query.

```typescript title="src/mastra/tools/weather-tool.ts"
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherTool = createTool({
  id: "weather-tool",
  description: "Fetches weather for a location",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    location: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    weather: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async (inputData) => {
    const { location } = inputData;

    const response = await fetch(`https://wttr.in/${location}?format=3`);
    const weather = await response.text();

    return { weather };
  },
});
```

## Adding tools to an agent

To make a tool available to an agent, add it to `tools`. Mentioning available tools and their general purpose in the agent's system prompt helps the agent decide when to call a tool and when not to.

An agent can use multiple tools to handle more complex tasks by delegating specific parts to individual tools. The agent decides which tools to use based on the user's message, the agent's instructions, and the tool descriptions and schemas.

```typescript {11} title="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { weatherTool } from "../tools/weather-tool";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  id: "weather-agent",
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions: `
      You are a helpful weather assistant.
      Use the weatherTool to fetch current weather data.`,
  model: "openai/gpt-5.1",
  tools: { weatherTool },
});
```

## Calling an agent

The agent uses the tool's `inputSchema` to infer what data the tool expects. In this case, it extracts `London` as the `location` from the message and passes it to the tool's inputData parameter.

```typescript title="src/test-tool.ts"
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");

const result = await agent.generate("What's the weather in London?");
```

## Using multiple tools

When multiple tools are available, the agent may choose to use one, several, or none, depending on what's needed to answer the query.

```typescript {7} title="src/mastra/agents/weather-agent.ts"
import { weatherTool } from "../tools/weather-tool";
import { activitiesTool } from "../tools/activities-tool";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent({
  id: "weather-agent",
  name: "Weather Agent",
  tools: { weatherTool, activitiesTool },
});
```

## Tools with structured output

When using tools with [structured output](/docs/v1/agents/structured-output), some models don't support combining both features in the same API call. If your tools aren't being called when structured output is enabled, or you receive errors about incompatible options, see [Combining tools and structured output](/docs/v1/agents/structured-output#combining-tools-and-structured-output) for model compatibility information and workarounds.
