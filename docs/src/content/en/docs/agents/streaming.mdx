# Agent Streaming

Agents in Mastra have access to a powerful streaming protocol! With seamless integration into tools or agents as a tool, you can stream responses directly back to your clients, creating a more interactive and engaging experience.

## Usage

To use the new protocol, you can use the `streamVNext` method on an agent. This method will return a custom MastraAgentStream. This stream extends a ReadableStream, so all basic stream methods are available.

```typescript
const stream = await agent.streamVNext({ role: "user", content: "Tell me a story." });

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

Each chunk is a JSON object with the following properties:

```json
{
  type: string;
  runId: string;
  from: string;
  payload: Record<string, any>;
}
```

We have a couple of utility functions on the stream to help you with the streaming process.

- `stream.finishReason` - The reason the agent stopped streaming.
- `stream.toolCalls` - The tool calls made by the agent.
- `stream.toolResults` - The tool results returned by the agent.
- `stream.usage` - The total token usage of the agent, including agents/workflows as a tool.
- `stream.text` - The full text of the agent's response.
- `stream.object` - The object of the agent's response, if you use output or experimental output.
- `stream.textStream` - A readable stream that will emit the text of the agent's response.

### How to use the stream in a tool

Each tool gets a `writer` argument, which is a writable stream with a custom write function. This write function is used to write the tool's response to the stream.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    conditions: z.string(),
    temperature: z.number(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city }, writer }) => {
    writer.write({
      type: "weather-data",
      args: {
        city
      },
      status: "pending"
    })
    // Tool logic here (e.g., API call)
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);

    writer.write({
      type: "weather-data",
      args: {
        city
      },
      status: "success",
      result: {
        temperature: 20,
        conditions: "Sunny"
      }
    })

    return { temperature: 20, conditions: "Sunny" }; // Example return
  },
});
```

If you want to use the stream in an agent, you can use the `streamVNext` method on the agent and pipe it to the agent's input stream.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/test-tool.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    text: z.string(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context: { city }, writer, mastra }) => {
    const agent = mastra.getAgent('weatherAgent')
    const stream = await agent.streamVNext(`What is the weather in ${city}?`);

    await stream.pipeTo(writer);

    return {
      text: await stream.text,
    }
  },
});
```

Piping the stream to the agent's input stream will allow us to automatically sum up the usage of the agent so the total usage count can be calculated.
