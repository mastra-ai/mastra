# Dynamic Agents

Dynamic agents use [runtime context](./runtime-variables), like user IDs and other important parameters, to adjust their settings in real-time.

This means they can change the model they use, update their instructions, and select different tools as needed.

By using this context, agents can better respond to each user's needs. They can also call any API to gather more information, which helps improve what the agents can do.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure a dynamic agent with runtime context. The agent adjusts its instructions, model, and tools depending on whether the user is a premium subscriber:

```typescript
const dynamicAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Master Chef Agent",
  instructions: async ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    // Fetch user preferences from an API using user ID from runtime context
    const userId = runtimeContext.get("userId");
    const prefs = await fetchUserPreferences(userId);
    const premium = runtimeContext.get("premiumUser") === true;

    const base = `The current user (${userId}) has the following preferences:
    - Allergies: ${prefs.allergies.join(", ") || "None"}
    - Preferred cuisines: ${prefs.cuisines.join(", ")}
    - Dietary restrictions: ${prefs.restrictions.join(", ") || "None"}`;

    return premium
      ? `You are a master chef creating gourmet dishes.\n${base}`
      : `You are a home cook giving simple recipes.\n${base}`;
  },
  model: ({ runtimeContext }) =>
    runtimeContext.get("premiumUser") === true
      ? openai("gpt-4o")
      : openai("gpt-3.5-turbo"),
  tools: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    const premium = runtimeContext.get("premiumUser") === true;
    return premium
      ? {
          recipeDatabase,
          ingredientSubstitutions,
          nutritionalCalculator,
        }
      : {
          recipeDatabase,
        };
  },
});
```

In this example, the agent's instructions, model, and tools are configured using the runtime context, allowing for a highly adaptable and responsive agent.
