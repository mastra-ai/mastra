description: Dynamically configure your agent's instruction, model and tools using runtime context.

# Dynamic Agents

Dynamic agents use [runtime context](./runtime-variables), like user IDs and other important parameters, to adjust their settings in real-time. This means they can change the model they use, update their instructions, and select different tools as needed. By using this context, agents can better respond to each user's needs. They can also call any API to gather more information, which helps improve what the agents can do.

## Key Benefits

- **Flexibility**: Adjust agent behavior dynamically without altering the core code.
- **Efficiency**: Consolidate multiple agents into a single dynamic agent.
- **Scalability**: Easily scale agent capabilities by modifying runtime context.

### Example Configuration

Here's an example of how to configure a dynamic agent with model, instructions, and tools:

```typescript
const dynamicAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Master Chef Agent",
  instructions: async ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    // Fetch user preferences from API using user ID from runtime context
    const userId = runtimeContext.get("userId");
    const userPreferences = await fetchUserPreferences(userId);

    return `You are a master chef specializing in personalized recipes. 
    The current user (${userId}) has the following dietary preferences:
    - Allergies: ${userPreferences.allergies.join(", ") || "None"}
    - Preferred cuisines: ${userPreferences.cuisines.join(", ")}
    - Dietary restrictions: ${userPreferences.restrictions.join(", ") || "None"}
    
    Tailor your cooking advice and recipes to match these preferences.`;
  },
  model: ({ runtimeContext }) => openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: ({ runtimeContext }) => {
    return {
      recipeDatabase,
      ingredientSubstitutions,
      nutritionalCalculator,
    };
  },
});
```

In this example, the agent's instructions, model, and tools are configured using the runtime context, allowing for a highly adaptable and responsive agent.
