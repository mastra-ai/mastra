# Workflows overview

Workflows let you define complex sequences of tasks using clear, structured steps rather than relying on the reasoning of a single agent. They give you full control over how tasks are broken down, how data moves between them, and what gets executed when. Workflow steps can be used to call tools, agents, execute code inline, or run other workflows.

## When to use workflows

Use workflows for tasks that are clearly defined upfront and involve multiple steps with a specific execution order. They give you fine-grained control over how data flows and transforms between steps, and which primitives are called at each stage.

## Core principles

Mastra workflows operate using these principles:

- Defining **steps** with `createStep`, specifying input/output schemas and business logic.
- Composing **steps** with `createWorkflow` to define the execution flow.
- Running **workflows** to execute the entire sequence, with built-in support for suspension, resumption, and streaming results.

## Creating a workflow step

Steps are the building blocks of workflows. Create a step using `createStep()` with `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` to define the data it accepts and returns.

The `execute` function defines what the step does. Use it to call functions in your codebase, external APIs, agents, or tools.

```typescript {6,9,15} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";

const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    formatted: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { message } = inputData;

    return {
      formatted: message.toUpperCase()
    };
  }
});
```

> See the [Step Class](/reference/workflows/step) for a full list of configuration options.

### Using agents and tools

Workflow steps can also call registered agents or import and execute tools directly, visit the [Using Tools](/docs/agents/using-tools) page for more information.

## Creating a workflow

Create a workflow using `createWorkflow()` with `inputSchema` and `outputSchema` to define the data it accepts and returns. Add steps using `.then()` and complete the workflow with `.commit()`.

```typescript {9,12,15,16} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const step1 = createStep({...});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();

```

> See the [Workflow Class](/reference/workflows/step) for a full list of configuration options.

### Understanding control flow

Workflows can be composed using a number of different methods. The method you choose determines how each step's schema should be structured. Visit the [Control Flow](/docs/workflows/control-flow) page for more information.

#### Composing workflow steps

When using `.then()`, steps run sequentially. Each stepâ€™s `inputSchema` must match the `outputSchema` of the previous step. The first step's `inputSchema` should match the workflow's `inputSchema` and the final stepâ€™s `outputSchema` should match the workflowâ€™s `outputSchema` to ensure end-to-end type safety.

```typescript {4,7,14,17,24,27} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({
  //...
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    formatted: z.string()
  })
});

const step2 = createStep({
  // ...
  inputSchema: z.object({
    formatted: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    emphasized: z.string()
  })
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  // ...
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    emphasized: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();
```

### Using a nested workflow

Use a nested workflow as a step by passing it to `.then()`. This allows the nested workflow to run each of its steps in sequence as part of the parent workflow, making it easy to compose larger flows from smaller, reusable workflows.

The nested workflow's `inputSchema` must match the output of the previous step, and its `outputSchema` must match the input of the next step. If they don't match, use `.map()` to transform the data between them.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy

const step1 = createStep({...});
const step2 = createStep({...});

const childWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "child-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    emphasized: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .then(step2)
  .commit();

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "nested-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    message: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    emphasized: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(childWorkflow)
  .commit();
```

### Cloning a workflow

Use `cloneWorkflow` to duplicate an existing workflow. This lets you reuse the original workflowâ€™s structure while changing specific properties like `id`. Cloning is useful when you want to build variations of a workflow without redefining its steps.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({...});

const parentWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
const clonedWorkflow = cloneWorkflow(parentWorkflow, { id: "cloned-workflow" });

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({...})
  .then(step1)
  .then(clonedWorkflow)
  .commit();
```


## Registering a workflow

Register your workflow in the Mastra instance to make it available throughout your application. Once registered, it can be called from agents or tools and has access to shared resources such as logging and observability features:

```typescript {6} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";
import { testWorkflow } from "./workflows/test-workflow";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  workflows: { testWorkflow },
});
```

## Referencing a workflow

You can run workflows from agents, tools, the Mastra Client, or the command line. Get a reference by calling `.getWorkflow()` on your `mastra` or `mastraClient` instance, depending on your setup:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const testWorkflow = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");
```
:::info
`mastra.getWorkflow()` is preferred over a direct import, since it provides access to the Mastra instance configuration (logger, telemetry, storage, registered agents, and vector stores).
:::

## Running workflows

Workflows can be run in two modes: start waits for all steps to complete before returning, and stream emits events during execution. Choose the approach that fits your use case: start when you only need the final result, and stream when you want to monitor progress or trigger actions as steps complete.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="start" label="Start">
Create a workflow run instance using `createRunAsync()`, then call `.start()` with `inputData` matching the workflow's `inputSchema`. The workflow executes all steps and returns the final result.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await testWorkflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    message: "Hello world"
  }
});

console.log(result);
```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="stream" label="Stream">
Create a workflow run instance using `.createRunAsync()`, then call `.stream()` with `inputData` matching the workflow's `inputSchema`. The workflow emits events as each step executes, which you can iterate over to track progress.

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
const run = await testWorkflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    message: "Hello world"
  }
});

for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Workflow output

The workflow output includes the full execution lifecycle, showing the input and output for each step. It also includes the status of each step, the overall workflow status, and the final result. This gives you clear insight into how data moved through the workflow, what each step produced, and how the workflow completed.

```json
{
  "status": "success",
  "steps": {
    // ...
    "step-1": {
      "status": "success",
      "payload": {
        "message": "Hello world"
      },
      "output": {
        "formatted": "HELLO WORLD"
      },
    },
    "step-2": {
      "status": "success",
      "payload": {
        "formatted": "HELLO WORLD"
      },
      "output": {
        "emphasized": "HELLO WORLD!!!"
      },
    }
  },
  "input": {
    "message": "Hello world"
  },
  "result": {
    "emphasized": "HELLO WORLD!!!"
  }
}
```

## Using `RequestContext`

Use [RuntimeContext](/docs/server-db/request-context) to access request-specific values. This lets you conditionally adjust behavior based on the context of the request.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers
export type UserTier = {
  "user-tier": "enterprise" | "pro";
};

const step1 = createStep({
  // ...
  execute: async ({ requestContext }) => {
    const userTier = requestContext.get("user-tier") as UserTier["user-tier"];

    const maxResults = userTier === "enterprise"
      ? 1000
      : 50;

    return { maxResults };
  }
});
```

> See [Request Context](/docs/server-db/request-context) for more information.

## Testing with Mastra Playground

Use the Mastra [Playground](/docs/getting-started/studio) to easily run workflows with different inputs, visualize the execution lifecycle, see the inputs and outputs for each step, and inspect each part of the workflow in more detail.
