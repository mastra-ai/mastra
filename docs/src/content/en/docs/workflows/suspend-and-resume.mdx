# Suspend & Resume

Workflows can be paused at any step to collect additional data, wait for API callbacks, throttle expensive operations, or wait for [Human in the Loop](/docs/workflows/human-in-the-loop) input. When a workflow is suspended, its current state can be persisted as a [snapshot](/docs/workflows/snapshots) and later resumed from a [specific step ID](/docs/workflows/snapshots#retrieving-snapshots). Snapshots are stored in the configured storage system and persist across deployments and application restarts.

## Pausing a workflow with `suspend()`

Use `suspend()` to pause workflow execution at a specific step. If a `resumeSchema` condition isn’t met, the workflow suspends at `return suspend()`. No further logic runs, and only the values passed to `suspend()` are returned. The step’s main return block is skipped, and workflow execution doesn’t continue.

```typescript {9-11,16-18} title="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const step1 = createStep({
  id: "step-1",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userEmail: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    okToSend: z.boolean()
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, resumeData, suspend }) => {
    const { userEmail } = inputData;
    const { okToSend } = resumeData ?? {};

    if (!okToSend) {
      return await suspend({});
    }

    await fetch("https://httpbin.org/post", {
      method: "POST",
      body: JSON.stringify({ to: userEmail })
    });

    return {
      output: `Email sent to ${userEmail}`
    };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    userEmail: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    output: z.string()
  })
})
  .then(step1)
  .commit();
```

## Restarting a workflow with `resume()`

Use `resume()` to restart a suspended workflow from the step where it paused. To satisfy the step’s suspend condition, pass a value using `resumeData` that matches the step's `resumeSchema`, allowing execution to continue from where it left off.

![Restarting a workflow with resume()](/img/workflows/workflows-suspend-resume-resume.jpg)

```typescript {13} showLineNumbers copy
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

await run.start({
  inputData: {
    userEmail: "alex@example.com"
  }
});

const handleResume = async () => {
  const result = await run.resume({
    step: 'step-1',
    resumeData: { okToSend: true }
  });
  console.log(result);
};
```

## Identifying suspended executions

When a workflow is suspended, it restarts from the step where it paused. You can check the workflow’s `status` to confirm it's suspended, and use `suspended` to identify the paused step or [nested workflow](/docs/workflows/overview#workflows-as-steps).

```typescript {11} showLineNumbers copy
const workflow = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow");
const run = await workflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: {
    userEmail: "alex@example.com"
  }
});

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  console.log(result.suspended[0]);
  await run.resume({
    step: result.suspended[0],
    resumeData: { okToSend: true }
  });
}
```

**Example output**

The `suspended` array contains the IDs of any suspended workflows and steps from the run. These can be passed to the `step` parameter when calling `resume()` to target and resume the suspended execution path.

```typescript
[ 'nested-workflow', 'step-1' ]
```

## Sleep & Events

Workflows can also pause execution for timed delays or external events. These methods set the workflow status to `waiting` rather than `suspended`, and are useful for polling, delayed retries, or event-driven processes.

**Available methods:**

- [`.sleep()`](/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleep): Pause for a specified number of milliseconds
- [`.sleepUntil()`](/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sleepUntil) : Pause until a specific date
- [`.waitForEvent()`](/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/waitForEvent): Pause until an external event is received
- [`.sendEvent()`](/reference/workflows/workflow-methods/sendEvent) : Send an event to resume a waiting workflow
