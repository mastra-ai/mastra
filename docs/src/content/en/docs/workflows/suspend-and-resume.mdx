# Suspend & Resume

Workflows can be paused at any step, with their current state persisted as a snapshot in storage. Execution can then be resumed from this saved snapshot when ready. Persisting the snapshot ensures the workflow state is maintained across sessions, deployments, and server restarts, essential for workflows that may remain suspended while awaiting external input or resources.


Common scenarios for suspending workflows include:

- Waiting for human approval or input
- Pausing until external API resources become available
- Collecting additional data needed for later steps
- Rate limiting or throttling expensive operations
- Handling event-driven processes with external triggers

## Workflow Status

When running a workflow, its `status` can be one of the following:

- `running` - The workflow is currently running
- `suspended` - The workflow is suspended
- `success` - The workflow has completed
- `failed` - The workflow has failed

## Suspend

When the state is `suspended`, you can identify any and all steps that have been suspended by looking at the `suspended` array of the workflow.


```typescript {17} filename="src/mastra/workflows/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const cityCoordinatesStep = createStep({
  id: "city-step",
  description: "Gets details about a city",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    suggestions: z.array(z.string())
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    outcome: z.string()
  }),
  execute: async ({ resumeData, suspend }) => {
    const { city } = resumeData ?? {};

    if (!city) {
      await suspend({});
      return {
        outcome: ""
      };
    }

    const geocodingResponse = await fetch(`https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search?name=${city}`);
    const geocodingData = await geocodingResponse.json();

    const { name, country, timezone } = geocodingData.results[0];

    return {
      outcome: `${name} | ${country} | ${timezone}`
    };
  }
});

export const testWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "test-workflow",
  description: 'Test workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    suggestions: z.array(z.string()),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    outcome: z.string(),
  })
})
  .then(cityCoordinatesStep)
  .commit();

```

## Resume

A workflow can be resumed by calling `resume` and providing the required `resumeData`.

```typescript {6,12,13,14} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const run = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRun();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { suggestions: ["London", "Paris", "New York"] }
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    step: 'city-step',
    resumeData: { city: "New York" }
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(resumedResult, null, 2));
}
```

To execute this run from your terminal:

```bash copy
npx tsx src/test-workflow.ts
```

### Nested Workflow

To resume a suspended nested workflow pass the workflow instance to the `step` parameter of the `resume` function.

```typescript {3} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await workflowRun.resume({
    step: [nestedWorkflow],
    resumeData: { city: "New York" }
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(resumedResult, null, 2));
}
```

## RuntimeContext

When using suspend/resume with `RuntimeContext`, you can create the instance yourself, and pass it to the `start` and `resume` functions.
`RuntimeContext` is not automatically shared on a workflow run.

```typescript {1,9,18} filename="src/test-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { RuntimeContext } from "@mastra/core/di";
import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const runtimeContext = new RuntimeContext();
const run = mastra.getWorkflow("testWorkflow").createRun();

const result = await run.start({
  inputData: { suggestions: ["London", "Paris", "New York"] },
  runtimeContext
});

console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2));

if (result.status === "suspended") {
  const resumedResult = await run.resume({
    step: 'city-step',
    resumeData: { city: "New York" },
    runtimeContext
  });

  console.log(JSON.stringify(resumedResult, null, 2));
}
```
