# Auth Overview

Mastra lets you choose how you handle authentication, so you can secure access to your application's endpoints using the identity system that fits your stack.

You can start with simple shared secret JWT authentication and switch to providers like Supabase, Firebase Auth, Auth0, Clerk, or WorkOS when you need more advanced identity features.

## Available providers

- [JSON Web Token (JWT)](/docs/server/auth/jwt)
- [Clerk](/docs/server/auth/clerk)
- [Supabase](/docs/server/auth/supabase)
- [Firebase](/docs/server/auth/firebase)
- [WorkOS](/docs/server/auth/workos)
- [Auth0](/docs/server/auth/auth0)
