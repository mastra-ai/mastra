# Streaming overview

Mastra supports real-time, incremental responses from agents and workflows, so users see output as it’s generated instead of waiting for completion. This is useful for chat, long-form content, multi-step workflows, or any scenario where immediate feedback matters.

## Getting started

Mastra currently supports two streaming methods:

1. **`.stream()`**: Current stable API.
2. **`.streamVNext()`**: Experimental API.

## Streaming with agents

Use `.stream()` for real-time responses. Pass a single string for simple prompts, an array of strings when providing multiple pieces of context, or an array of message objects with `role` and `content` for precise control over roles and conversational flows.

A `textStream` breaks the response into chunks as it’s generated, allowing output to stream progressively instead of arriving all at once.

### Using `Agent.stream()`

The `.stream()` method is the current stable streaming implementation for agents.

```typescript {3,7} showLineNumbers copy
const testAgent = mastra.getAgent("testAgent");

const stream = await testAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Help me organize my day" },
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

> See [Agent.stream()](../../reference/agents/stream.mdx) for more information.

### Using `Agent.streamVNext()`

The `.streamVNext()` method is the experimental streaming API that provides enhanced capabilities and improved performance.

```typescript {3,7} showLineNumbers copy
const testAgent = mastra.getAgent("testAgent");

const stream = await testAgent.streamVNext([
  { role: "user", content: "Help me organize my day" },
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

> See [Agent.streamVNext()](../../reference/agents/streamVNext.mdx) for more information.
