# Streaming Overview

Mastra supports real-time, incremental responses from agents and workflows, allowing users to see output as it’s generated instead of waiting for completion. This is useful for chat, long-form content, multi-step workflows, or any scenario where immediate feedback matters.

## Getting started

Mastra currently supports two streaming methods:

1. **`.stream()`**: Current stable API.
2. **`.streamVNext()`**: Experimental API.

## Streaming with agents

You can pass a single string for simple prompts, an array of strings when providing multiple pieces of context, or an array of message objects with `role` and `content` for precise control over roles and conversational flows.

A `textStream` breaks the response into chunks as it’s generated, allowing output to stream progressively instead of arriving all at once.

### Using `Agent.stream()`

This is the current stable API.

```typescript {3,7} showLineNumbers copy
const testAgent = mastra.getAgent("testAgent");

const stream = await testAgent.stream([
  { role: "user", content: "Help me organize my day" },
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

> See [Agent.stream()](../../reference/agents/stream.mdx) for more information.

### Output from `Agent.stream()`

The output shows the generated response from the agent.

```text

### Using `Agent.streamVNext()`

This is the experimental API.

```typescript {3,7} showLineNumbers copy
const testAgent = mastra.getAgent("testAgent");

const stream = await testAgent.streamVNext([
  { role: "user", content: "Help me organize my day" },
]);

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

> See [Agent.streamVNext()](../../reference/agents/streamVNext.mdx) for more information.

### Output from `Agent.streamVNext()`

The output shows the generated response from the agent.

```text
Of course!

```

## Streaming with workflows

Streaming from a workflow returns a sequence of structured events describing the run lifecycle, rather than incremental text chunks. This event-based format makes it possible to track and respond to workflow progress in real time once a run is created.

### Using `Run.stream()`

This is the current stable API. It returns an object with a `stream` property containing `ReadableStream` events.

```typescript {3,9} showLineNumbers copy
const run = await testWorkflow.createRunAsync();

const result = await run.stream({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data"
  }
});

for await (const chunk of result.stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

> See [Run.stream()](../../reference/workflows/run-methods/stream.mdx) for more information.

### Output from `Run.stream()`

The stable API event structure nests all data (except `type`) under `payload`.

```typescript
// ...
{
  type: 'step-start',
  payload: {
    id: 'step-1',
    stepCallId: '0746ca4e-7595-446e-8b23-752ce7e7a584',
    payload: { value: 'initial data' },
    startedAt: 1755121714139,
    status: 'running'
  }
}
```

### Using `Run.streamVNext()`

This is the experimental API. It returns a `ReadableStream` of events directly.

```typescript {3,9} showLineNumbers copy
const run = await testWorkflow.createRunAsync();

const stream = await run.streamVNext({
  inputData: {
    value: "initial data"
  }
});

for await (const chunk of stream) {
  console.log(chunk);
}
```

> See [Run.streamVNext()](../../reference/workflows/run-methods/streamVNext.mdx) for more information.

### Output from `Run.streamVNext()`

The experimental API event structure includes `runId` and `from` at the top level, making it easier to identify and track workflow runs without digging into the payload.

```typescript
// ...
{
  type: 'step-start',
  runId: '1eeaf01a-d2bf-4e3f-8d1b-027795ccd3df',
  from: 'WORKFLOW',
  payload: {
    stepName: 'step-1',
    args: { value: 'initial data' },
    stepCallId: '8e15e618-be0e-4215-a5d6-08e58c152068',
    startedAt: 1755121710066,
    status: 'running'
  }
}
```
