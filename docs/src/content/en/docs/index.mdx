# About Mastra


Trusted by companies shaping the future of agents - including PayPal, Replit, and SoftBank - Mastra is a framework for building AI-powered applications and agents with a modern TypeScript stack. 

It includes everything you need to go from early prototypes to production-ready applications under one roof. Mastra integrates smoothly with frontend frameworks like React and Next.js and can deploy anywhere. It's the easiest way to build, tune, and scale reliable AI products.

## Why Mastra?

Purpose-built for TypeScript and designed around established AI patterns, Mastra gives you everything you need to build great AI applications out-of-the-box.

Some highlights include:


- [LLM routing](/models) - Connect to 40+ providers through one standard interface. Use models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, and more.

- [Agents](/docs/agents/overview) - Build autonomous agents that use LLMs to run [tools](/) in a loop and tackle open-ended tasks. Mastra manages that loop so agents can plan, call tools, and adapt with human-like reasoning.

- [Workflows](/) - When you need explicit control over execution, use Mastra's graph-based workflow engine to orchestrate complex multi-step processes. Mastra workflows use an intuitive syntax for control flow (`.then()`, `.branch()`, `.parallel()`).

- [Human-in-the-loop](/) -  Suspend an agent or workflow and await user input or approval before resuming. Suspension uses Mastra's [storage](/) to remember execution state, so you can pause indefinitely and resume where you left off.

- [Context management](/) - Give your agents the right context at the right time. Provide [conversation history](/), [retrieve](/) data from your sources (APIs, databases, files), and give your agents human-like [memory](/) to stay informed and grounded.

- [Integrations](/) - Bundle agents and workflows into existing React, Next.js, or Node.js apps, or ship them as standalone endpoints. Integrate with agentic UI libraries like Vercel's AI SDK UI, CopilotKit, and Assistant UI to bring your AI assistant to life on the web.

- [Production essentials](/) - Shipping reliable agents takes ongoing insight, evaluation, and iteration. With built-in [evals]() and [observability](), Mastra gives you the tools to observe, measure, and refine continuously. To [deploy](/), bundle agents and workflows into a Node.js server using Hono, or target a serverless platform like Vercel, Cloudflare, Netlify, or Mastra Cloud.


## What can you build?
Use Mastra to build:

- AI-powered applications that combine language understanding, reasoning, and action to solve real-world tasks

- Conversational agents for customer support, onboarding, or internal queries

- Domain-specific copilots for coding, legal, finance, research, or creative work

- Workflow automations that trigger, route, and complete multi-step processes

- Decision-support tools that analyse data and provide actionable recommendations
