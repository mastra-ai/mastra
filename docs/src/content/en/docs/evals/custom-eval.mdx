# Create a custom eval

Creating your own eval is as easy as creating a new function. You simply create a class that extends the `Metric` class and implement the `measure` method.

## Basic example

For a simple example of creating a custom metric that checks if the output contains certain words, see our [Word Inclusion example](/examples/evals/word-inclusion.mdx).

## LLM Judge example

A custom LLM judge helps evaluate specific aspects of your AI generated responses. Think of it like having an expert reviewer for your particular use case:

- **Fact Checker**: Judge checks against factual information.
- **Customer Service**: Judge evaluates tone and helpfulness.
- **Code Generation**: Judge verifies code correctness and style.


For a complete example of building a custom LLM judge and metric that evaluates real-world factual accuracy, see the [Real World Countries example](/examples/evals/custom-eval.mdx).
