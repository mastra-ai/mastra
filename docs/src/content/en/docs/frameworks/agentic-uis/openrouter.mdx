# Use OpenRouter with Mastra

Integrate OpenRouter with Mastra to leverage the numerous models available on OpenRouter.

<Steps>

<StepItem>

The simplest way to get started with Mastra is to use the `mastra` CLI to initialize a new project:

```bash copy
npx create-mastra@beta
```

You'll be guided through prompts to set up your project. For this example, select:

- Name your project: my-mastra-openrouter-app
- Components: Agents (recommended)
- For default provider, select OpenAI (recommended) - we'll configure OpenRouter manually later
- Optionally include example code

</StepItem>

<StepItem>

After creating your project with `create-mastra`, you'll find a `.env` file in your project root.
Since we selected OpenAI during setup, we'll configure OpenRouter manually:

```bash title=".env" copy
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=
```

We remove the `@ai-sdk/openai` package from the project:

```bash copy
npm uninstall @ai-sdk/openai
```

Then, we install the `@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider` package:

```bash copy
npm install @openrouter/ai-sdk-provider
```

</StepItem>

<StepItem>

We will now configure our agent to use OpenRouter.

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" copy showLineNumbers {4-6,11}
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

export const assistant = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"),
});
```

Make sure to register your agent to the Mastra instance:

```typescript title="src/mastra/index.ts" copy showLineNumbers {4}
import { assistant } from "./agents/assistant";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { assistant },
});
```

</StepItem>

<StepItem>

```bash copy
npm run dev
```

This will start the Mastra development server.

You can now test your agent by visiting [http://localhost:4111](http://localhost:4111) and using Studio or via the Mastra API at [http://localhost:4111/api/agents/assistant/stream](http://localhost:4111/api/agents/assistant/stream).

## Advanced Configuration

For more control over your OpenRouter requests, you can pass additional configuration options.

### Provider-wide options:

You can pass provider-wide options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" {6-10} copy showLineNumbers
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
  extraBody: {
    reasoning: {
      max_tokens: 10,
    },
  },
});

export const assistant = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4"),
});
```

### Model-specific options:

You can pass model-specific options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/assistant.ts" {11-17} copy showLineNumbers
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { createOpenRouter } from "@openrouter/ai-sdk-provider";

const openrouter = createOpenRouter({
  apiKey: process.env.OPENROUTER_API_KEY,
});

export const assistant = new Agent({
  id: "assistant",
  name: "assistant",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: openrouter("anthropic/claude-sonnet-4", {
    extraBody: {
      reasoning: {
        max_tokens: 10,
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

### Provider-specific options:

You can pass provider-specific options to the OpenRouter provider:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers {7-12}
// Get a response with provider-specific options
const response = await assistant.generate([
  {
    role: "system",
    content:
      "You are Chef Michel, a culinary expert specializing in ketogenic (keto) diet...",
    providerOptions: {
      // Provider-specific options - key can be 'anthropic' or 'openrouter'
      anthropic: {
        cacheControl: { type: "ephemeral" },
      },
    },
  },
  {
    role: "user",
    content: "Can you suggest a keto breakfast?",
  },
]);
```
