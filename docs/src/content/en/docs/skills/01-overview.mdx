# Skills

Skills are **folders of reusable instructions, scripts, and resources** that can be loaded dynamically into your agents. They allow you to package specific capabilities (like "Code Review", "Documentation Writer", or "SQL Expert") and equip your agents with them on-demand or conditionally.

## Why use Skills?

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Instead of one massive system prompt, break instructions into manageable, improved "skills".
2. **Reusability**: Use the same "Code Review" skill across multiple agents.
3. **Dynamic Loading**: Load skills only when needed (e.g. only load "Admin Skill" for admin users).
4. **Interoperability**: Mastra skills follow the industry-standard folder format compatible with other agent frameworks.

## Structure of a Skill

A skill is simply a folder with a `SKILL.md` file:

```bash
.mastra/skills/
└── my-skill/
    ├── SKILL.md       # Required: Frontmatter + Instructions
    ├── examples/      # Optional: Usage examples
    ├── resources/     # Optional: Reference files
    └── scripts/       # Optional: Helper scripts
```

### SKILL.md

The `SKILL.md` file contains YAML configuration and the actual instructions:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Expert at reviewing TypeScript code for best practices
version: 1.0.0
tags: [coding, quality]

# Code Review Instructions

You are an expert code reviewer. When reviewing code, follow these guidelines:

1. Check for type safety
2. Ensure proper error handling
3. Verify test coverage
```

## Using Skills with Agents

You can add skills to an agent using the `skills` configuration option.

### Method 1: Static Skills

Pass an array of file paths to skill directories.

```typescript
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';

const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Code Reviewer',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant.',
  model: { provider: 'OPENAI', name: 'gpt-4' },
  skills: [
    './.mastra/skills/code-review',
    './.mastra/skills/typescript-best-practices'
  ]
});
```

### Method 2: Dynamic Skills

Pass a function that returns skill paths based on context.

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  // ...
  skills: async ({ requestContext }) => {
    const userRole = requestContext.get('userRole');
    
    // Only admins get the "System Admin" skill
    if (userRole === 'admin') {
      return ['./skills/system-admin'];
    }
    
    return ['./skills/basic-user'];
  }
});
```

## Creating Skills via CLI

Mastra provides CLI tools to generate skills quickly.

```bash
# Create a new skill
mastra skill create my-new-skill

# Validate a skill
mastra skill validate .mastra/skills/my-new-skill

# List available skills
mastra skill list
```
