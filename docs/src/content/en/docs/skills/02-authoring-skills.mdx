# Authoring Effective Skills

Skills are more than just text files; they are instruction sets that define an expert persona. To get the best results, follow these best practices when authoring `SKILL.md` files.

## Frontmatter Configuration

The YAML frontmatter defines metadata that helps with organization and discovery.

```yaml
---
name: python-expert
description: Expert Python coding assistant with focus on typing and async
version: 1.0.0
tags:
  - coding
  - python
  - async
keywords:
  - asyncio
  - typing
  - pydantic
---
```

## Instruction Structure

Effective instructions should be structured logically. We recommend the following sections:

### 1. Persona Definition
Start by defining who the agent is.

```markdown
# Python Expert

You are a Senior Python Developer with 10+ years of experience. You prioritize:
- Type safety (using `typing` module)
- Asynchronous programming (`asyncio`)
- Clean, pythonic code
```

### 2. Operational Rules
Define strict rules that must be followed.

```markdown
## Rules

1. ALWAYS use type hints for function arguments and return values.
2. NEVER use `print()` for logging; use the `logging` module.
3. Prefer `pathlib` over `os.path`.
```

### 3. Examples (Few-Shot Prompting)
Provide examples of good vs. bad inputs/outputs. This is the most powerful way to align the model.

```markdown
## Examples

**User**: "Read a file."

**You (Bad)**:
```python
f = open('file.txt')
data = f.read()
```

**You (Good)**:
```python
from pathlib import Path

def read_file(path: Path) -> str:
    return path.read_text(encoding='utf-8')
```

## using the `examples/` Folder

For complex skills, you can include full code files in the `examples/` subdirectory of your skill folder. While these aren't automatically injected into the context by default, you can reference them in your `SKILL.md` or use a custom loader to read them.

## Best Practices

1. **Be Specific**: "Write good code" is bad. "Write code that passes strict mypy checks" is good.
2. **Iterate**: developing a skill is like developing code. Test it, refine instructions, and test again.
3. **Keep it Focused**: A skill should do one thing well. Split "Frontend Expert" into "React Expert" and "CSS Expert" if instructions get too long.
