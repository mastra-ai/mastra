# Local Development

Mastra provides a local development environment where you can test your agents, workflows, and tools during development.

Start the local development server by running:

<Tabs items={["npm", "Mastra CLI"]}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npm run dev
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    mastra dev
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

The local development server provides access to the following interfaces:

- Playground: [http://localhost:4111/](http://localhost:4111/)
- Mastra API: [http://localhost:4111/api](http://localhost:4111/api)
- OpenAPI Spec: [http://localhost:4111/openapi.json](http://localhost:4111/openapi.json)
- Swagger UI â€“ API explorer: [http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui](http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui)

## Playground

The Playground lets you interact with your agents, workflows, and tools. It provides dedicated interfaces for testing each component of your Mastra application during development and is available at: [http://localhost:4111/](http://localhost:4111/).

### Agents

Quickly test and debug your agents during development using the interactive chat interface in the Agent Playground.

<Image src="/image/local-dev/local-dev-agents-playground.jpg" alt="Agent Playground" width={1512} height={945} />

Key features:

- **Chat Interface**: Directly interact with your agents to test their responses and behavior.
- **Model Settings**: View and modify sampling parameters that control how the model generates responses.
- **Agent Endpoints**: See all available REST API routes to understand how to interact with your agents.
- **Agent Traces**: View detailed execution traces to understand how your agent processes requests.
- **Agent Evals**: Run evaluations and view results to compare agent performance.

### Workflows

Validate workflows by supplying defined inputs and visualizing each step within the Workflow Playground.

<Image src="/image/local-dev/local-dev-workflow-playground.jpg" alt="Workflows Playground" width={1512} height={945} />

Key features:

- **Workflow Visualization**: Explore a visual graph of your workflow structure to understand step flow and branching logic.
- **Step Inputs & Outputs**: View the input and output data for each step to understand how information moves through the workflow.
- **Run Workflows**: Trigger test runs using defined inputs to validate logic, simulate paths, and debug execution.
- **Execution JSON**: View and copy the complete workflow run as JSON, including inputs, outputs, errors, and step results.
- **Workflow Traces**: Inspect detailed traces showing step-by-step execution, data flow, tool calls, and error handling.

### Tools

Quickly test and debug custom tools in isolation using the Tools Playground, without running a full agent or workflow.

<Image src="/image/local-dev/local-dev-tools-playground.jpg" alt="Tools Playground" width={1512} height={945} />

Key features:

- **Test Tools in Isolation**: Run tools independently without needing to execute a full agent or workflow.
- **Input & Responses**: Provide test data and view how the tool responds.
- **Tool Usage**: See which agents are using a tool to understand its integration and impact.

### MCP Servers

Explore connection details, tool usage, and IDE configuration for local MCP server development.

<Image src="/image/local-dev/local-dev-mcp-server-playground.jpg" alt="MCP Server Playground" width={1512} height={945} />

Key features:

- **Connection Details**: View the SSE and HTTP URLs, along with cursor and `windsurf` configuration for connecting MCP clients to this server.
- **Included Tools**: See a list of all tools currently published to the server, including their names, versions, and usage metadata.
- **IDE Configuration**: Copy-paste-ready config to link your local setup with the MCP server for tool testing and publishing.

## REST API Endpoints

The local development server exposes a set of REST API routes via the [Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server), allowing you to test and interact with your agents and workflows before deployment.

For a full overview of available API routes, including agents, tools, and workflows, see the [Routes reference](/reference/cli/dev#routes).

## OpenAPI Specification

The local development server includes an OpenAPI specification available at: [http://localhost:4111/openapi.json](http://localhost:4111/openapi.json).

To include OpenAPI documentation in your production server, enable it in the Mastra instance:

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  server: {
    build: {
      openAPIDocs: true,
  },
});
```

## Swagger UI

The local development server includes an interactive Swagger UI - API explorer available at: [http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui](http://localhost:4111/swagger-ui).

To include Swagger UI in your production server, enable it in the Mastra instance:

```typescript {7} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  server: {
    build: {
      swaggerUI: true,
    },
  },
});
```

## Architecture

The local development server runs fully self-contained without external dependencies or containers. It leverages:

- **Dev Server** powered by [Hono](https://hono.dev) for the core [Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server).
- **In-Memory Storage** via [LibSQL](https://libsql.org/) adapters for agent memory, traces, evals, and workflow snapshots.
- **Vector Storage** using [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) for embeddings, vector search, and semantic retrieval.

This setup lets you start developing immediately with production-like behavior, no database or vector store setup required.

### Server Configuration

By default, the server runs on port `4111`. You can customize the host and port through the Mastra server configuration.

```typescript {6,7} filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...
  server: {
    port: 8080,
    host: "0.0.0.0",
  },
});
```
