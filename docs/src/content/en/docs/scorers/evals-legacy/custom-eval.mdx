# Create a Custom Eval

:::info Scorers
This documentation refers to the legacy evals API. For the latest scorer features, see [Scorers](/docs/v0/scorers/overview).
:::

Create a custom eval by extending the `Metric` class and implementing the `measure` method. This gives you full control over how scores are calculated and what information is returned. For LLM-based evaluations, extend the `MastraAgentJudge` class to define how the model reasons and scores output.

## Native JavaScript evaluation

You can write lightweight custom metrics using plain JavaScript/TypeScript. These are ideal for simple string comparisons, pattern checks, or other rule-based logic.

See our [Word Inclusion example](/examples/v0/evals/custom-native-javascript-eval), which scores responses based on the number of reference words found in the output.

## LLM as a judge evaluation

For more complex evaluations, you can build a judge powered by an LLM. This lets you capture more nuanced criteria, like factual accuracy, tone, or reasoning.

See the [Real World Countries example](/examples/v0/evals/custom-llm-judge-eval) for a complete walkthrough of building a custom judge and metric that evaluates real-world factual accuracy.
