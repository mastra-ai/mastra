# Templates Overview

Mastra templates are pre-built project structures that demonstrate specific use cases and patterns for building Mastra applications. They provide a starting point for common scenarios, allowing you to quickly bootstrap projects with working examples.

## What are Templates?

Templates are complete Mastra projects that showcase:

- **Specific use cases** - Each template focuses on a particular application pattern (e.g., chatbots, document analysis, workflow automation)
- **Best practices** - Templates follow Mastra conventions and demonstrate proper project structure
- **Working examples** - All templates include functional code that you can run immediately
- **Educational value** - Templates serve as learning resources for different Mastra features

## How Templates Work

When you install a template using the `create-mastra` command with a `--template` flag, it creates a complete project with all the necessary code and configuration.
This gives you a working example that you can immediately run and customize for your specific needs.

## Getting Started

To start using templates:

1. Browse available templates in the [templates directory](https://mastra.ai/templates)
2. [Install a template using the create-mastra command](/docs/templates/using-templates)
3. Follow the template's README for setup instructions
4. Customize the template for your specific use case

Templates provide an efficient way to learn Mastra patterns and accelerate your Mastra application development.
