# Skills

Skills are reusable instructions that teach agents how to perform specific tasks. They follow the [Agent Skills specification](https://agentskills.io) - an open standard for packaging agent capabilities.

## How it works

A skill is a folder containing:

- **SKILL.md** - Instructions and metadata for the agent
- **references/** - Supporting documentation (optional)
- **scripts/** - Executable scripts (optional)
- **assets/** - Images and other files (optional)

```
/skills
  /code-review
    SKILL.md
    /references
      style-guide.md
      pr-checklist.md
    /scripts
      lint.ts
```

When skills are configured on a workspace, agents can discover and activate them during conversations.

## SKILL.md structure

A skill file contains YAML frontmatter followed by markdown instructions:

```markdown
---
name: code-review
description: Reviews code for quality, style, and potential issues
version: 1.0.0
tags:
  - development
  - review
---

# Code Review

You are a code reviewer. When reviewing code:

1. Check for bugs and edge cases
2. Verify the code follows the style guide in references/style-guide.md
3. Suggest improvements for readability
4. Run the linter using scripts/lint.ts

## What to look for

- Unused variables and imports
- Missing error handling
- Security vulnerabilities
- Performance issues
```

## Configuring skills

Enable skill discovery by setting the `skills` option on your workspace:

```typescript
import { Workspace, LocalFilesystem } from '@mastra/core/workspace';

const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
});
```

You can specify multiple skill directories:

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: [
    '/skills',           // Project skills
    '/team-skills',      // Shared team skills
  ],
});
```

## Dynamic skills

For dynamic skill paths based on context, pass a function:

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: (context) => {
    const paths = ['/skills'];
    if (context.user?.role === 'developer') {
      paths.push('/dev-skills');
    }
    return paths;
  },
});
```

## How agents use skills

When skills are configured, agents receive a `SkillsProcessor` that:

1. Lists available skills in the system message
2. Allows agents to activate skills during conversation
3. Provides access to skill references and scripts

Agents can reference skill content in their responses and use scripts defined in skills to perform actions.

## Skill search

If BM25 or vector search is enabled on the workspace, skills are automatically indexed. Agents can search across skill content to find relevant instructions.

```typescript
const workspace = new Workspace({
  filesystem: new LocalFilesystem({ basePath: './workspace' }),
  skills: ['/skills'],
  bm25: true, // Enable skill search
});
```
