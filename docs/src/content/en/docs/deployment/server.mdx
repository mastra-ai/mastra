# Creating A Mastra Server

While developing or when you deploy a Mastra application, it runs as an HTTP server that exposes your agents, workflows, and other functionality as API endpoints. This page explains how to configure and customize the server behavior.

## Server Architecture

Mastra uses [Hono](https://hono.dev) as its underlying HTTP server framework. When you build a Mastra application using `mastra build`, it generates a Hono-based HTTP server in the `.mastra` directory.

The server provides:

- API endpoints for all registered agents
- API endpoints for all registered workflows
- Custom api route supports
- Custom middleware support
- Configuration of timeout
- Configuration of port
- Configuration of body limit

See the [Middleware](/docs/deployment/middleware) and
[Custom API Routes](/docs/deployment/custom-api-routes) pages for details on
adding additional server behaviour.

## Server configuration

You can configure server `port` and `timeout` in the Mastra instance.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    port: 3000, // Defaults to 4111
    timeout: 10000, // Defaults to 30000 (30s)
  },
});
```

The `method` option can be one of `"GET"`, `"POST"`, `"PUT"`,
`"DELETE"` or `"ALL"`. Using `"ALL"` will cause the handler to be
invoked for any HTTP method that matches the path.

## Custom CORS Config

Mastra allows you to configure CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) settings for your server.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    cors: {
      origin: ["https://example.com"], // Allow specific origins or '*' for all
      allowMethods: ["GET", "POST", "PUT", "DELETE", "OPTIONS"],
      allowHeaders: ["Content-Type", "Authorization"],
      credentials: false,
    },
  },
});
```

## Deployment

Since Mastra builds to a standard Node.js server, you can deploy to any platform that runs Node.js applications:

- Cloud VMs (AWS EC2, DigitalOcean Droplets, GCP Compute Engine)
- Container platforms (Docker, Kubernetes)
- Platform as a Service (Heroku, Railway)
- Self-hosted servers

### Building

Build the application:

```bash copy
# Build from current directory
mastra build

# Or specify a directory
mastra build --dir ./my-project
```

The build process:

1. Locates entry file (`src/mastra/index.ts` or `src/mastra/index.js`)
2. Creates `.mastra` output directory
3. Bundles code using Rollup with tree shaking and source maps
4. Generates [Hono](https://hono.dev) HTTP server

See [`mastra build`](/reference/cli/build) for all options.

### Running the Server

Start the HTTP server:

```bash copy
node .mastra/output/index.mjs
```

### Enable Telemetry for build output

Load instrumentation for the build output like so:

```bash copy
node --import=./.mastra/output/instrumentation.mjs  .mastra/output/index.mjs
```

## Serverless Deployment

Mastra also supports serverless deployment on Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify.

See our [Serverless Deployment](/docs/deployment/deployment) guide for setup instructions.
