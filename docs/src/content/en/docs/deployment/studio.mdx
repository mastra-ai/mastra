# Deploying Studio

- Introduction what Studio is and link to getting started studio page to see features
- Explain key distinction: mastra studio is a standalone, static UI that connects to an already-running Mastra server
- Explain that this page is about how to deploy Studio on your own server
- If you want a plug-and-play solution, use Mastra Cloud

## `mastra studio` command

- Explain that `mastra studio` command exists
- Explain what it does and what you should do after starting (let the user try it out)
- Explain that after initial screen, it saves the settings in local storage. In the sidebar on settings tab you can modify the settings afterwards
- The header is for authentication
- The instance URL and API prefix options allow for both `mastra build` + `mastra start` and server adapters approach
- Loads `.env.production` and `.env` files from current working directory

## Running alongside Mastra server

- You can use `mastra build --studio` to build both the Mastra server and studio together. When you then run `MASTRA_STUDIO_PATH=.mastra/output/studio node .mastra/output/index.mjs` they are served together

## Running on your own server

- Explain to run `mastra studio` on your server and keep it running (e.g. using pm2 or systemd)
- When Studio runs on a server, it's a browser-side SPA that makes requests to the Mastra API server. If Studio and the server are on different hosts/ports, CORS becomes relevant. Worth mentioning.
- Studio gives full access to your agents, workflows, and tools. Mention that you should put it behind authentication (reverse proxy with auth, VPN, etc.) in production.

## SPA Deployment

- Explain how to create a SPA out of the `mastra/dist/studio` folder and replace the placeholders with values
- Explain that you then can deploy this to Netlify, Vercel, etc.
- List available env vars that need to be set
