# Custom API Routes

By default Mastra automatically exposes registered agents and workflows via the
server. For additional behaviour you can define your own HTTP routes.

Routes are provided with a helper `registerApiRoute` from `@mastra/core/server`.
Routes can live in the same file as the `Mastra` instance but separating them
helps keep configuration concise.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { registerApiRoute } from "@mastra/core/server";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  server: {
    apiRoutes: [
      registerApiRoute("/my-custom-route", {
        method: "GET",
        handler: async (c) => {
          const mastra = c.get("mastra");
          const agents = await mastra.getAgent("my-agent");

          return c.json({ message: "Hello, world!" });
        },
      }),
    ],
  },
});
```

Each route's handler receives the Hono `Context`. Within the handler you can
access the `Mastra` instance to fetch or call agents and workflows.

To add route-specific middleware pass a `middleware` array when calling
`registerApiRoute`.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers
registerApiRoute("/my-custom-route", {
  method: "GET",
  middleware: [
    async (c, next) => {
      console.log(`${c.req.method} ${c.req.url}`);
      await next();
    },
  ],
  handler: async (c) => {
    return c.json({ message: "My route with custom middleware" });
  },
});
```
