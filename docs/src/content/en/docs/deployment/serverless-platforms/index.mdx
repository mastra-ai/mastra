# Serverless Deployment

This guide covers deploying standalone Mastra applications to Cloudflare Workers, Vercel, and Netlify using platform-specific deployers.

Deployers **aren't** required when integrating Mastra with a framework. See [Web Framework Integration](/docs/deployment/web-framework) for more information.

For self-hosted Node.js server deployment, see the [Creating A Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server) guide.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 18 or higher is recommended)
- If using a platform-specific deployer:
  - An account with your chosen platform
  - Required API keys or credentials

## Serverless Platform Deployers

Platform-specific deployers handle configuration and deployment for:

- **[Cloudflare Workers](/reference/deployer/cloudflare)**
- **[Vercel](/reference/deployer/vercel)**
- **[Netlify](/reference/deployer/netlify)**
- **[Mastra Cloud](/docs/mastra-cloud/overview)** _(beta)_. You can join the [cloud waitlist](https://mastra.ai/cloud-beta) for early access.
