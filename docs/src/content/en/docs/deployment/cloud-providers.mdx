## Digital Ocean

   <Tabs.Tab>
      Deploy your Mastra application to Digital Ocean's App Platform using your preferred Git repository provider.

      #### Prerequisites

      - A Git repository containing your Mastra application. This can be a GitHub repository, GitLab repository, or any other compatible source provider.
      - A Digital Ocean account

      #### Deployment Steps

      <Steps>
      ##### Create a new App
      - Log in to your Digital Ocean dashboard.
      - Navigate to the App Platform service.
      - Select your source provider and create a new app.

      ##### Configure Deployment Source
      - Connect and select your repository. You may also choose a container image or a sample app.
      - Select the branch you want to deploy from.
      - Configure the source directory if necessary. If your Mastra application uses the default directory structure, no action is required here.
      - Head to the next step.

      ##### Configure Resource Settings and Environment Variables
      - A Node.js build should be detected automatically.
      - Add any required environment variables for your Mastra application. This includes API keys, database URLs, and other configuration values.
      - You may choose to configure the size of your resource here.
      - Other things you may optionally configure include, the region of your resource, the unique app name, and what project the resource belongs to.
      - Once you're done, you may create the app after reviewing your configuration and pricing estimates.

      ##### Deployment
      - Your app will be built and deployed automatically.
      - Digital Ocean will provide you with a URL to access your deployed application.
      </Steps>

      You can now access your deployed application at the URL provided by Digital Ocean.

      <Callout>
         The Digital Ocean App Platform uses an ephemeral file system, meaning that any files written to the file system are short-lived and may be lost.
         Avoid using a Mastra storage provider that uses the file system, such as `LibSQLStore` with a file URL.
