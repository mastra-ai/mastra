# Deployment Overview

Mastra applications can be deployed to any Node.js-compatible environment. You can deploy a Mastra server, integrate with an existing web framework, deploy to cloud providers, or use Mastra Cloud for managed hosting.

## Runtime support

Mastra can run against any of these runtime environments:

- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later
- Bun
- Deno
- Cloudflare

## Deployment Options

### Mastra Server

Mastra provides a [server](../server/mastra-server) powered by Hono that can be deployed independently. Use the `mastra build` command to build your application and deploy the output to your preferred VM, container, or PaaS platform.

See the [Mastra server deployment guide](./mastra-server).

### Monorepo

Deploy a Mastra server as part of a monorepo setup, following the same approach as standalone deployment.

Read about [monorepo deployment](./monorepo).

### Cloud Providers

Mastra applications can be deployed to cloud providers and serverless platforms. Mastra includes optional built-in deployers for Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare to automate the build and deployment process.

- [Amazon EC2](../../../guides/v1/deployment/amazon-ec2)
- [AWS Lambda](../../../guides/v1/deployment/aws-lambda)
- [Azure App Services](../../../guides/v1/deployment/azure-app-services)
- [Cloudflare](../../../guides/v1/deployment/cloudflare-deployer)
- [Digital Ocean](../../../guides/v1/deployment/digital-ocean)
- [Netlify](../../../guides/v1/deployment/netlify-deployer)
- [Vercel](../../../guides/v1/deployment/vercel-deployer)

### Web Framework

When Mastra is integrated with a web framework, it deploys alongside your application using the framework's standard deployment process. The guides below cover framework-specific configuration requirements for deployment:

- [With Next.js on Vercel](./web-framework#with-nextjs-on-vercel)
- [With Astro on Vercel](./web-framework#with-astro-on-vercel)
- [With Astro on Netlify](./web-framework#with-astro-on-netlify)

### Mastra Cloud

We're building Mastra Cloud to be the easiest place to deploy and observe your Mastra agents. It's currently in beta.

Learn more in the [Mastra Cloud docs](../mastra-cloud/overview).

## Workflow Runners

Mastra supports deploying workflows to specialized workflow execution platforms that handle orchestration, monitoring, and reliability. [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com) is a developer platform for running background workflows without managing infrastructure. Mastra workflows can be deployed to Inngest, which provides step memoization, automatic retries, real-time monitoring, and suspend/resume capabilities.
