# Deployment Overview

Mastra applications can be deployed to any Node.js-compatible environment. You can deploy a Mastra server, integrate with an existing web framework, deploy to cloud providers, or use Mastra Cloud for managed hosting.

## Runtime support

Mastra can run against any of these runtime environments:

- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later
- Bun
- Deno
- [Cloudflare](/guides/v1/deployment/cloudflare-deployer)

## Deployment Options

### Mastra Server

Mastra provides a [Mastra server](/docs/v1/server/mastra-server) powered by Hono that can be deployed independently.

- Custom API routes and middleware
- Configurable CORS and authentication
- Deploy to VMs, containers, or PaaS platforms
- Integrate with existing Node.js applications

### Monorepo

Deploy Mastra as part of a monorepo setup, following the same approach as standalone deployment.

### Web Framework

Mastra can be integrated with a variety of web frameworks. When integrated with a framework, Mastra typically requires no additional configuration for deployment.

- [With Astro on Netlify →](./web-framework#with-astro-on-netlify)

### Cloud Providers

Mastra applications can be deployed to cloud providers like AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, Vercel, and Netlify. Mastra includes optional built-in deployers for some platforms to streamline the deployment process.

Mastra Cloud is a deployment platform that connects to your GitHub repository, automatically deploys on code changes, and provides monitoring tools. It includes:

- GitHub repository integration
- Deployment on git push
- Agent testing interface
- Comprehensive logs and traces
- Custom domains for each project
