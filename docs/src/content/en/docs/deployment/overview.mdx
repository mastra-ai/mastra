# Deployment Overview

Mastra applications can be deployed to any Node.js-compatible environment. You can deploy a Mastra server, integrate with an existing web framework, deploy to cloud providers, or use Mastra Cloud for managed hosting.

## Runtime support

Mastra can run against any of these runtime environments:

- Node.js `v22.13.0` or later
- Bun
- Deno
- Cloudflare

## Deployment Options

### Mastra Server

Mastra provides a [server](/docs/v1/server/mastra-server) powered by Hono that can be deployed independently. Use the `mastra build` command to build your application and deploy the output to your preferred VM, container, or PaaS platform.

Visit the [Mastra server deployment guide](/docs/v1/deployment/mastra-server).

### Monorepo

Deploy a Mastra server as part of a monorepo setup, following the same approach as standalone deployment.

Read about [monorepo deployment](/docs/v1/deployment/monorepo).

### Cloud Providers

Mastra applications can be deployed to cloud providers and serverless platforms. Mastra includes optional built-in deployers for Vercel, Netlify, and Cloudflare to automate the build and deployment process.

- [Amazon EC2](/guides/v1/deployment/amazon-ec2)
- [AWS Lambda](/guides/v1/deployment/aws-lambda)
- [Azure App Services](/guides/v1/deployment/azure-app-services)
- [Cloudflare](/guides/v1/deployment/cloudflare-deployer)
- [Digital Ocean](/guides/v1/deployment/digital-ocean)
- [Netlify](/guides/v1/deployment/netlify-deployer)
- [Vercel](/guides/v1/deployment/vercel-deployer)

### Web Framework

When Mastra is integrated with a web framework, it deploys alongside your application using the framework's standard deployment process. The guides below cover framework-specific configuration requirements for deployment:

- [With Next.js on Vercel](/docs/v1/deployment/web-framework#with-nextjs-on-vercel)
- [With Astro on Vercel](/docs/v1/deployment/web-framework#with-astro-on-vercel)
- [With Astro on Netlify](/docs/v1/deployment/web-framework#with-astro-on-netlify)

### Mastra Cloud

We're building Mastra Cloud to be the easiest place to deploy and observe your Mastra agents. It's currently in beta.

Learn more in the [Mastra Cloud docs](/docs/v1/mastra-cloud/overview).

## Workflow Runners

Mastra workflows run using the built-in execution engine by default. For production workloads requiring managed infrastructure, workflows can also be deployed to specialized platforms like [Inngest](https://www.inngest.com) that provide step memoization, automatic retries, and real-time monitoring.

Visit the [Workflow Runners guide](/docs/v1/deployment/workflow-runners) for execution options and the [Inngest deployment guide](/guides/v1/deployment/inngest) for setup instructions.
