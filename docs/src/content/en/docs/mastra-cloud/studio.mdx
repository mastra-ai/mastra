# Studio

<YouTube id="ojGu6Bi4wYk" />

Mastra Cloud provides a hosted version of [Studio](/docs/v1/getting-started/studio) that gives your team a shared environment for interacting with and testing your agents. Team members can chat with agents, review traces, give feedback, and tweak system prompts - without needing to run the project locally.

[Setup your project](/docs/v1/mastra-cloud/setup) to access Studio in the cloud.

See the [Studio documentation](/docs/v1/getting-started/studio) for details on features like the Agents playground, Workflows runner, Tools testing, and MCP Servers.

:::note
You don't need to deploy your agent to use Studio. Studio runs in a sandbox environment separate from your production deployment

## Sharing access

To invite team members, go to [Mastra Cloud](https://cloud.mastra.ai), click **Team Settings**, then **Members** to add them. Once invited, they can sign in and access your project's Studio.
