# Mastra Cloud

[Mastra Cloud](https://mastra.ai/cloud) is a platform for deploying, managing, monitoring, and debugging Mastra applications. When you [deploy](/docs/mastra-cloud/setting-up) your application, Mastra Cloud exposes your agents, tools, and workflows as REST API endpoints.

<MastraCloudCallout />

## Platform features

Deploy and manage your applications with automated builds, organized projects, and no additional configuration.

![Platform features](/image/mastra-cloud/mastra-cloud-platform-features.jpg)

Key features:

- **Zero Config**: Deploy Mastra applications without additional configuration
- **Continuous Integration**: Automatically deploy on every push to GitHub
- **Atomic Deployments**: Agents, tools and workflows deploy as a single unit
- **Project Organization**: Host multiple projects with unique URLs
- **Integrated Storage**: Use built-in memory and storage with [LibSQLStore](/docs/storage/overview)

## Project Dashboard

Monitor and debug your applications with detailed output logs, deployment state, and interactive tools.

![Project dashboard](/image/mastra-cloud/mastra-cloud-project-dashboard.jpg)

Key features:

- **Overview**: Your project's status, domains, latest deployments and connected agents and workflows
- **Deployments**: Full list of deployments, status and commit references
- **Logs**: Monitor behavior and debug issues
- **Playground**: The same functionality as our [Local Playground](/docs/local-dev/mastra-dev), in the Cloud

## Project structure

Use a standard Mastra project structure for proper detection and deployment.

<FileTree>
  <FileTree.Folder name="src" defaultOpen>
    <FileTree.Folder name="mastra" defaultOpen>
      <FileTree.Folder name="agents" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="agent-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="tools" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="tool-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.Folder name="workflows" defaultOpen>
        <FileTree.File name="workflow-name.ts" />
      </FileTree.Folder>
      <FileTree.File name="index.ts" />
    </FileTree.Folder>
  </FileTree.Folder>
  <FileTree.File name="package.json" />
</FileTree>

Mastra Cloud scans your repository for:

- **Agents**: Defined using: `new Agent({...})`
- **Tools**: Defined using: `createTool({...})`
- **Workflows**: Defined using: `createWorkflow({...})`
- **Steps**: Defined using: `createStep({...})`
- **Environment Variables**: API keys and configuration variables

## Technical implementation

Mastra Cloud runs on a platform optimized for AI agents and workflows.

Key features:

- **Extended Timeouts**: Supports longer-running requests than typical serverless platforms
- **Dynamic Resource Allocation**: Adjusts compute based on traffic
- **Tracing Infrastructure**: Records all execution steps for agents and workflows
- **Built for Mastra**: Optimized to run Mastra agents, tools, and workflows without configuration
- **Evals**: Evaluate agent and workflow performance with repeatable, versioned test cases
