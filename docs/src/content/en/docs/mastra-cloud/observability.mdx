# Understanding Tracing and Logs

Mastra Cloud captures execution data to help you monitor your application's behavior in the production environment.

<MastraCloudCallout />

## Logs

You can view detailed logs for debugging and monitoring your application's behavior on the [Logs](/docs//mastra-cloud/dashboard#logs) page of the Dashboard.

![Dashboard logs](/image/mastra-cloud/mastra-cloud-dashboard-logs.jpg)

Key features:

- **Time**: When the log entry was recorded
- **Level**: Log severity, such as info or debug
- **Hostname**: Identifies which server handled the request
- **Message**: API startup, storage activity, and agent or workflow call details

## Traces

More detailed traces are available for both agents and workflows by using a [logger](/docs/observability/logging) or enabling [telemetry](/docs/observability/tracing) using one of our [supported providers](/reference/observability/providers).

### Agents

With a [logger](/docs/observability/logging) enabled, you can view detailed outputs from your agents in the **Traces** section of the Agents Playground.

![observability agents](/image/mastra-cloud/mastra-cloud-observability-agents.jpg)

Key features:

- **generate**: Ran the agent using the configured tools and model
   - **convertTools**: Converted tool definitions into a standard format
      - **getAssignedTools**: Retrieved tools assigned to the agent
      - **getToolSets**: Retrieved sets of tools passed during streaming or generation
      - **getMemoryTools**: Retrieved memory tools used by the agent
      - **getClientTools**: Retrieved tools that run on the client side
      - **getWorkflowTools**: Retrieved workflows exposed as tools
   - **ai.generateText**: Generated a response using the configured language model
      - **ai.generateText.doGenerate**: Handled the text generation with parameters and runtime context
      - **ai.toolCall**: Executed tool calls during generation


### Workflows

With a [logger](/docs/observability/logging) enabled, you can view detailed outputs from your workflows in the **Traces** section of the Workflows Playground.

![observability workflows](/image/mastra-cloud/mastra-cloud-observability-workflows.jpg)

Key features:

- **runWorkflow**: Ran a workflow with input and options
- **createWorkflow**: Set up a new workflow by defining its steps, schema, metadata, and tools
- **executeWorkflow**: Handled the step-by-step execution of a workflow
   - **initializeContext**: Set up the shared context used across all workflow steps
   - **executeStep**: Ran a single step using the current context and memory
   - **shouldRunStep**: Checked whether a step should run based on its conditions and current state
   - **mergePartialContext**: Merged step output into the existing context
   - **isValidStepOutput**: Validated that the step output was an object
- **getWorkflowSchema**: Built the workflowâ€™s input/output schema based on its steps
- **createWorkflowTool**: Wrapped a workflow as a tool so it could be used inside agents or other workflows
