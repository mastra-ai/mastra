## Continuous integration

Your project is now configured with automatic deployments which occur whenever you push to the configured branch of your GitHub repository.

## Testing your application

After a successful deployment you can test your agents and workflows [Studio](/docs/v1/mastra-cloud/dashboard#studio) in Mastra Cloud, or interact with them using our [Client SDK](/docs/v1/server-db/mastra-client).
