# Deployment

Deploy your Mastra application to production and expose your agents, tools, and workflows as REST API endpoints.

:::info
Mastra Cloud is currently in beta, but many teams are already using it to deploy their agents. It's the easiest way to run Mastra agents in a managed environment.
:::

## Enable deployments

After [setting up your project](/docs/mastra-cloud/setup), click **Deployment** in the sidebar and select **Enable Deployments**.

Once enabled, your project automatically builds and deploys. Future pushes to your main branch trigger automatic redeployments.

## Dashboard

The **Overview** page shows your project's domain URL, status, latest deployment, and connected agents and workflows.

Click the **Deployments** menu item to view build logs. Open **Settings** to configure environment variables, branch, storage, and endpoint URLs. 

:::note
Changes to settings require a new deployment to take effect
:::

## Using your deployment

After deployment, interact with your agents using the [Mastra Client](/docs/server/mastra-client) or call the REST API endpoints directly.
