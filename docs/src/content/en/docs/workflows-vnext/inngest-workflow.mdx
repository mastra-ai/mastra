# Inngest Workflow

[Inngest](https://www.inngest.com/docs) is a developer platform for building and running background workflows, without managing infrastructure.

## How Inngest Works with Mastra

Inngest provides an event delivery and orchestration layer for running Mastra vNext workflows in response to events. The integration connects Inngest's event system to Mastra's workflow engine.

Workflows are defined using Mastra's `createWorkflow` and `createStep` helpers, which map directly to Inngest functions through a memoized creation process. Each step of workflow is registered as a single Inngest function with a unique ID, created once and cached for efficiency. When an event occurs, Inngest invokes the corresponding function, creating a workflow run that executes steps in sequence within Inngest's context. Real-time monitoring is provided through Inngest's publish-subscribe system, where the watch method subscribes to a specific channel `workflow:${workflowId}:${runId}` for execution updates. Results are available through Inngest's API and dashboard, including status, outputs, and any errors.

## Setup

```sh
npm install @mastra/inngest @mastra/core @mastra/deployer
```

## Building an Inngest Workflow

This guide walks through creating a workflow with Inngest and Mastra, demonstrating a counter application that increments a value until it reaches 10.

### Inngest Initialization

Initialize the Inngest integration to obtain Mastra-compatible workflow helpers. The createWorkflow and createStep functions are used to create workflow and step objects that are compatible with Mastra and inngest.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/inngest/index.ts"
import { Inngest } from 'inngest'
import { realtimeMiddleware } from '@inngest/realtime'

export const inngest = new Inngest({
    id: 'mastra',
    baseUrl: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'
      ? 'https://api.inngest.com'
      : 'http://localhost:8288',
    isDev: process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production',
    middleware: [realtimeMiddleware()],
})
```

### Creating Steps

Define the individual steps that will compose your workflow:

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts"
import { z } from 'zod'
import { inngest } from '../inngest'
import { init } from '@mastra/inngest'

// Initialize Inngest with Mastra, pointing to your local Inngest server
const { createWorkflow, createStep } = init(inngest)

// Step: Increment the counter value
const incrementStep = createStep({
  id: 'increment',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    return { value: inputData.value + 1 }
  },
})
```

### Creating the Workflow

Compose the steps into a workflow using the `dountil` loop pattern. The createWorkflow function creates a function on inngest server that is invokable.

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/workflows/index.ts"
// workflow that is registered as a function on inngest server
const workflow = createWorkflow({
  id: 'increment-workflow',
  inputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    value: z.number(),
  }),
}).then(incrementStep)

workflow.commit()

export { workflow as incrementWorkflow }
```

### Configuring the Mastra Instance and Executing the Workflow

Register the workflow with Mastra and configure the Inngest API endpoint:

```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core/mastra'
import { serve as inngestServe } from '@mastra/inngest'
import { incrementWorkflow } from './workflows'
import { inngest } from './inngest'
import { PinoLogger } from '@mastra/loggers'


// Configure Mastra with the workflow and Inngest API endpoint
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  vnext_workflows: {
    incrementWorkflow
  },
  server: {
    // The server configuration is required to expose the Inngest integration endpoint.
    // This server acts as a bridge between Mastra and Inngest, allowing:
    // - Inngest to discover and register Mastra workflows
    // - Inngest to send events to trigger workflow executions
    // - Real-time communication for workflow monitoring and updates
    host: '0.0.0.0',
    apiRoutes: [
      // This API route is used to register the Mastra workflow (inngest function) on the inngest server
      {
        path: '/api/inngest',
        method: 'ALL',
        createHandler: async ({ mastra }) => inngestServe({ mastra, inngest }),
      },
    ],
  },
  logger: new PinoLogger({
    name: 'Mastra',
    level: 'info',
  }),
})
```

### Running the Workflow locally

> **Prerequisites:**
> - Docker installed and running
> - Mastra project set up
> - Dependencies installed (`npm install`)

1. Run `npx mastra dev` to start the Mastra server on local to serve the server on port 4111.
2. Start the Inngest Dev Server (via Docker)
In a new terminal, run:
```sh
docker run --rm -p 8288:8288 \
  inngest/inngest \
  inngest dev -u http://host.docker.internal:4111/inngest/api
```
> **Note:** The URL after `-u` tells the Inngest dev server where to find your Mastra `/api/inngest` endpoint.

3. Open the Inngest Dashboard
- Visit [http://localhost:8288](http://localhost:8288) in your browser.
- Go to the **Apps** section in the sidebar.
- You should see your Mastra workflow registered.
![Inngest Dashboard](/inngest-apps-dashboard.png)

4. Invoke the Workflow
- Go to the **Functions** section in the sidebar.
- Select your Mastra workflow.
- Click **Invoke** and use the following input:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "inputData" : {
        "value": 5
    }
  }
}
```

5. **Monitor the Workflow Execution**
- Go to the **Runs** tab in the sidebar.
- Click on the latest run to see step-by-step execution progress.

### Running the Workflow in Production

> **Prerequisites:**
> - Vercel account and Vercel CLI installed (`npm i -g vercel`)
> - Inngest account
> - Vercel token (recommended: set as environment variable)

1. Add Vercel Deployer to Mastra instance
```ts showLineNumbers copy filename="src/mastra/index.ts"
import { VercelDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-vercel'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // ...other config
  deployer: new VercelDeployer({
    teamSlug: "your_team_slug",
    projectName: "your_project_name",
    // you can get your vercel token from the vercel dashboard by clicking on the user icon in the top right corner 
    // and then clicking on "Account Settings" and then clicking on "Tokens" on the left sidebar.
    token: "your_vercel_token",
  }),
})
```

> **Note:** Set your Vercel token in your environment:
> ```sh
> export VERCEL_TOKEN=your_vercel_token
> ```

2. Build the mastra instance
```sh
npx mastra build
```

3. Deploy to Vercel
```sh
cd .mastra/output
vercel --prod
```
> **Tip:** If you haven't already, log in to Vercel CLI with `vercel login`.

4. Sync with Inngest Dashboard
- Go to the [Inngest dashboard](https://app.inngest.com/env/production/apps).
- Click **Sync new app with Vercel** and follow the instructions.
- You should see your Mastra workflow registered as an app.

5. Invoke the Workflow
- In the **Functions** section, select `workflow.increment-workflow`.
- Click **All actions** (top right) > **Invoke**.
- Provide the following input:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "inputData" : {
        "value": 5
    }
  }
}
```
