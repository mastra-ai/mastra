# Azure

Azure models are accessed through Mastra's [Azure Gateway documentation](/models/v1/gateways/azure). That page covers deployment naming, required environment variables, autocomplete tips, and usage examples.

This stub page exists to keep old links working. If you reached it from a bookmark, please update the URL to the gateway guide.
