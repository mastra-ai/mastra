# Working memory

Use working memory to help agents remember key facts, track user details, and maintain context across conversations.

Working memory works with both streamed responses using `.stream()` and generated responses using `.generate()`, and requires a storage provider such as PostgreSQL, LibSQL, or Redis to persist data between sessions.

This example shows how to enable working memory in an agent and interact with it across multiple messages in the same thread.

## Prerequisites

This example uses the `openai` model. Make sure to add `OPENAI_API_KEY` to your `.env` file.

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

And install the following package:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/libsql
```

## Adding memory to an agent

To add LibSQL memory to an agent, use the `Memory` class and pass a `storage` instance using `LibSQLStore`. The `url` can point to a remote location or local file.

### Enable working memory

Enable working memory by setting `workingMemory.enabled` to `true`. This allows the agent to remember information from earlier conversations and persist structured data between sessions.

Threads group related messages into distinct conversations. When `generateTitle` is enabled, each thread is automatically named based on its content.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/example-working-memory-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

export const workingMemoryAgent = new Agent({
  name: "working-memory-agent",
  instructions: "You are an AI agent with the ability to automatically recall memories from previous interactions.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory: new Memory({
    storage: new LibSQLStore({
      url: "file:working-memory.db"
    }),
    options: {
      workingMemory: {
        enabled: true
      },
      threads: {
        generateTitle: true
      }
    }
  })
});
```

## Usage example

This example shows how to interact with an agent that has working memory enabled. The agent remembers information shared across multiple interactions within the same thread.

### Streaming a response using `.stream()`

This example sends two messages to the agent within the same thread. The response is streamed and includes information remembered from the first.

```typescript filename="src/test-working-memory-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import "dotenv/config";

import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const threadId = "123";
const resourceId = "user-456";

const agent = mastra.getAgent("workingMemoryAgent");

await agent.stream("My name is Mastra", {
  memory: {
    thread: threadId,
    resource: resourceId
  }
});

const stream = await agent.stream("What do you know about me?", {
  memory: {
    thread: threadId,
    resource: resourceId
  }
});

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

### Generating a response using `.generate()`

This example sends two messages to the agent within the same thread. The response is returned as a single message and includes information remembered from the first.

```typescript filename="src/test-working-memory-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import "dotenv/config";

import { mastra } from "./mastra";

const threadId = "123";
const resourceId = "user-456";

const agent = mastra.getAgent("workingMemoryAgent");

await agent.generate("My name is Mastra", {
  memory: {
    thread: threadId,
    resource: resourceId
  }
});

const response = await agent.generate("What do you know about me?", {
  memory: {
    thread: threadId,
    resource: resourceId
  }
});

console.log(response.text);
```

## Example output

The output demonstrates the agent has used it's memory to recall information.

```text
I know that your first name is Mastra.
If there's anything else you'd like to share or update, feel free to let me know!
```
