# Custom LLM Judge Scorer

This example shows how to create a custom LLM-based scorer using `createLLMScorer`. We'll build a "Gluten Checker" that evaluates whether a recipe contains gluten, using a language model as the judge.

## Installation

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/evals
```

> For complete API documentation and configuration options, see [`createLLMScorer`](/reference/scorers/llm-scorer).

## Create a custom LLM scorer

A custom LLM scorer in Mastra uses `createLLMScorer` to define:
- **Instructions** for the LLM judge
- **Prompt** for the analyze step
- **Zod schema** for the expected output
- **Scoring logic**
- (Optionally) a reason step for explanations

> See [createLLMScorer](/reference/scorers/llm-scorer.mdx) for the full API and configuration options.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/evals/gluten-checker.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { createLLMScorer } from "@mastra/core/scores";
import { z } from "zod";

const GLUTEN_INSTRUCTIONS = `You are a Chef that identifies if recipes contain gluten.`;

const generateGlutenPrompt = ({ output }: { output: string }) => `
You are a chef who checks if a recipe contains gluten. List all ingredients in the recipe that contain gluten and return them in a JSON object.

Gluten is commonly found in:
- Wheat (including wheat flour, whole wheat, semolina, durum, spelt, farro, etc.)
- Barley (including malt, malt extract, malt vinegar)
- Rye
- Triticale
- Products made from these grains (e.g., bread, pasta, cake, cookies, seitan, beer, soy sauce unless labeled gluten-free)

**Instructions:**
- Carefully read the recipe and list every ingredient that contains gluten.
- If an ingredient is ambiguous (e.g., "flour" without specifying type), assume it contains gluten unless otherwise stated.
- If you are unsure, include the ingredient and note it in a comment in the JSON (see example).
- If there are no gluten-containing ingredients, return an empty array.

**Return ONLY the following JSON object, with no extra text:**
{
  "glutenSources": ["list of gluten-containing ingredients"]
}

=== Recipe to analyze ===
${output}
=== End of recipe to analyze ===
JSON:
`;

const generateReasonPrompt = ({ isGlutenFree, glutenSources }: { isGlutenFree: boolean; glutenSources: string[] }) => `Explain why this recipe is${isGlutenFree ? '' : ' not'} gluten-free.\n${glutenSources.length > 0 ? `Sources of gluten: ${glutenSources.join(', ')}` : 'No gluten-containing ingredients found'}\nReturn your response in this format:\n{\n  "reason": "This recipe is [gluten-free/contains gluten] because [explanation]"\n}`;

export const glutenCheckerScorer = createLLMScorer({
  name: 'Gluten Checker',
  description: 'Check if the output contains any gluten',
  judge: {
    model: openai('gpt-4o'),
    instructions: GLUTEN_INSTRUCTIONS,
  },
  analyze: {
    description: 'Analyze the output for gluten',
    outputSchema: z.object({ glutenSources: z.array(z.string()) }),
    createPrompt: ({ run }) => generateGlutenPrompt({ output: run.output.text }),
  },
  calculateScore: ({ run }) => run.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources.length > 0 ? 0 : 1,
  reason: {
    createPrompt: ({ run }) => generateReasonPrompt({
      glutenSources: run.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources,
      isGlutenFree: run.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources.length === 0,
    }),
  },
});
```

## High gluten-free example

```typescript filename="src/example-high-gluten-free.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const input = 'Mix rice, beans, and vegetables';
const output = 'Mix rice, beans, and vegetables';
const result = await glutenCheckerScorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { text: output },
});
console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('Gluten sources:', result.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources);
console.log('Reason:', result.reason);
```

### High gluten-free output

```typescript
{
  score: 1,
  analyzeStepResult: { glutenSources: [] },
  reason: 'This recipe is gluten-free because no gluten-containing ingredients were found.'
}
```

## Partial gluten example

```typescript filename="src/example-partial-gluten.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const input = 'Mix flour and water to make dough';
const output = 'Mix flour and water to make dough';
const result = await glutenCheckerScorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { text: output },
});
console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('Gluten sources:', result.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources);
console.log('Reason:', result.reason);
```

### Partial gluten output

```typescript
{
  score: 0,
  analyzeStepResult: { glutenSources: ['flour'] },
  reason: 'This recipe is not gluten-free because it contains flour.'
}
```

## Low gluten-free example

```typescript filename="src/example-low-gluten-free.ts" showLineNumbers copy
const input = 'Add soy sauce and noodles';
const output = 'Add soy sauce and noodles';
const result = await glutenCheckerScorer.run({
  input: [{ role: 'user', content: input }],
  output: { text: output },
});
console.log('Score:', result.score);
console.log('Gluten sources:', result.analyzeStepResult.glutenSources);
console.log('Reason:', result.reason);
```

### Low gluten-free output

```typescript
{
  score: 0,
  analyzeStepResult: { glutenSources: ['soy sauce', 'noodles'] },
  reason: 'This recipe is not gluten-free because it contains soy sauce, noodles.'
}
```

## Understanding the results

`.run()` returns a result in the following shape:

```typescript
{
  runId: string,
  analyzeStepResult: {
    glutenSources: string[]
  },
  score: number,
  reason: string
}
```

### score
A score of 1 means the recipe is gluten-free. A score of 0 means gluten was detected.

### runId
The unique identifier for this scorer run.

### analyzeStepResult
Object with gluten sources:
- **glutenSources**: Array of gluten-containing ingredients found in the recipe.

### reason
Explanation of why the recipe is or is not gluten-free.
