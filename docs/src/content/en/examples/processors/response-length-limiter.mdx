# Response Length Limiter

This example shows how to create a custom output processor that monitors and limits the length of AI responses during streaming. This processor tracks cumulative response length and aborts generation when a specified character limit is reached, helping control costs and response quality.

## Create a custom output processor

A custom output processor in Mastra implements the `Processor` interface with the `processOutputStream` method for streaming responses. This processor tracks the cumulative length of text deltas and terminates the stream when the limit is exceeded.

```typescript title="src/mastra/processors/response-length-limiter.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import type { Processor } from "@mastra/core/processors";
import type { ChunkType } from "@mastra/core/stream";

type ResponseLengthLimiterOptions = {
  maxLength?: number;
  strategy?: "block" | "warn" | "truncate";
};

export class ResponseLengthLimiter implements Processor {
  readonly name = "response-length-limiter";
  private maxLength: number;
  private strategy: "block" | "warn" | "truncate";

  constructor(options: ResponseLengthLimiterOptions | number = {}) {
    if (typeof options === "number") {
      this.maxLength = options;
      this.strategy = "block";
    } else {
      this.maxLength = options.maxLength ?? 1000;
      this.strategy = options.strategy ?? "block";
    }
  }

  async processOutputStream({
    part,
    streamParts,
    state,
    abort,
  }: {
    part: ChunkType;
    streamParts: ChunkType[];
    state: Record<string, unknown>;
    abort: (reason?: string) => never;
  }): Promise<ChunkType | null | undefined> {
    if (!state.cumulativeLength) {
      state.cumulativeLength = 0;
    }

    if (part.type === "text-delta") {
      const newLength = state.cumulativeLength + part.payload.text.length;

      if (newLength > this.maxLength) {
        switch (this.strategy) {
          case "block":
            abort(
              `Response too long: ${newLength} characters (max: ${this.maxLength})`,
            );
            break;
          case "warn":
            console.warn(
              `Warning: Response length ${newLength} exceeds recommended limit of ${this.maxLength} characters`,
            );
            state.cumulativeLength = newLength;
            return part;
          case "truncate":
            const remainingChars = this.maxLength - state.cumulativeLength;
            if (remainingChars > 0) {
              const truncatedText = part.payload.text.substring(
                0,
                remainingChars,
              );
              state.cumulativeLength = this.maxLength;
              return {
                ...part,
                payload: { ...part.payload, text: truncatedText },
              };
            }
            return null;
        }
      }

      state.cumulativeLength = newLength;
    }

    return part;
  }
}
```

### Key components

- **Constructor**: Accepts options object or number
- **Strategy options**: Choose how to handle length violations:
  - `'block'`: Stop generation and abort the stream (default)
  - `'warn'`: Log warning but continue streaming
  - `'truncate'`: Cut off text at the exact limit
- **State tracking**: Uses processor state to track cumulative text length across stream parts
- **Text delta filtering**: Only counts `text-delta` parts in the character limit
- **Dynamic handling**: Applies the chosen strategy when limits are exceeded

### Using the processor

Using the options object approach with explicit strategy configuration:

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/blocking-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { ResponseLengthLimiter } from "../processors/response-length-limiter";

export const blockingAgent = new Agent({
  name: "blocking-agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant with response length limits",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  outputProcessors: [
    new ResponseLengthLimiter({ maxLength: 1000, strategy: "block" }),
  ],
});
```

Using the simple number approach (defaults to 'block' strategy):

```typescript title="src/mastra/agents/simple-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { ResponseLengthLimiter } from "../processors/response-length-limiter";

export const simpleAgent = new Agent({
  name: "simple-agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  outputProcessors: [new ResponseLengthLimiter(300)],
});
```

## High example (within limits)

This example shows a response that stays within the configured character limit and streams successfully to completion.

```typescript title="src/example-high-response-length.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { ResponseLengthLimiter } from "./mastra/processors/response-length-limiter";

// Create agent with generous response limit
export const agent = new Agent({
  name: "response-limited-agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant. Keep responses concise.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  outputProcessors: [
    new ResponseLengthLimiter(300), // 300 character limit
  ],
});

const result = await agent.generate("What is the capital of France?");
console.log(result.text);
console.log("Character count:", result.text.length);
```

### High example output

The response completes successfully because it stays under the 300-character limit:

```typescript
"The capital of France is Paris. It's located in the north-central part of the country and serves as the political, economic, and cultural center of France."

Character count: 156
```

## Partial example (reaches limits)

This example shows what happens when a response reaches exactly the character limit during generation.

```typescript title="src/example-partial-response-length.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { ResponseLengthLimiter } from "./mastra/processors/response-length-limiter";

// Reuse same agent but with stricter response limit
export const agent = new Agent({
  name: "response-limited-agent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  outputProcessors: [
    new ResponseLengthLimiter(200), // Strict 200 character limit
  ],
});

const result = await agent.generate("Explain machine learning in detail.");

if (result.tripwire) {
  console.log("Response blocked:", result.tripwireReason);
  console.log("Partial response received:", result.text);
} else {
  console.log(result.text);
}
console.log("Character count:", result.text.length);
```

### Partial example output

The response is cut off when it hits the 200-character limit:

```typescript
Response blocked: Response too long: 201 characters (max: 200)
Partial response received: "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It uses algori"
Character count: 200
```

## Low example (exceeds limits with streaming)

This example demonstrates streaming behavior when the response limit is exceeded.

```typescript title="src/example-low-response-length.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { ResponseLengthLimiter } from "./mastra/processors/response-length-limiter";

// Reuse same agent but with very strict response limit
export const agent = new Agent({
  name: "response-limited-agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a verbose assistant who provides detailed explanations.",
  model: "openai/gpt-4o",
  outputProcessors: [
    new ResponseLengthLimiter(100), // Very strict 100 character limit
  ],
});

const stream = await agent.stream(
  "Write a comprehensive essay about artificial intelligence.",
);

let responseText = "";
let wasBlocked = false;
let blockReason = "";

for await (const part of stream.fullStream) {
  if (part.type === "text-delta") {
    responseText += part.payload.text;
    process.stdout.write(part.payload.text);
  } else if (part.type === "tripwire") {
    wasBlocked = true;
    blockReason = part.payload.tripwireReason;
    console.log("\n\nStream blocked:", blockReason);
    break;
  }
}

if (wasBlocked) {
  console.log("Final response length:", responseText.length);
  console.log("Reason:", blockReason);
}
```

### Low example output

The stream is blocked when the response exceeds the 100-character limit:

```typescript
Artificial intelligence represents one of the most transformative technologies of our time. It encom

Stream blocked: Response too long: 101 characters (max: 100)
Final response length: 100
Reason: Response too long: 101 characters (max: 100)
```

## Understanding the results

When using `ResponseLengthLimiter`, the processor:

### Successful processing

- **Within limits**: Responses under the character limit stream normally to completion
- **Real-time tracking**: Monitors length incrementally as text deltas are generated
- **State persistence**: Maintains cumulative count across all stream parts

### Blocked processing

- **Exceeded limits**: Generation stops immediately when limit is reached
- **Tripwire flag**: `result.tripwire = true` or stream emits `tripwire` chunk
- **Partial content**: Users receive content generated up to the block point
- **No exceptions**: Check `result.tripwire` or handle `tripwire` chunks in streams

### Stream behavior

- **Text-delta counting**: Only text content counts toward the limit
- **Other parts ignored**: Non-text parts (like function calls) don't affect the counter
- **Immediate termination**: No additional content is generated after abort

### Configuration options

- **maxLength**: Set the character limit (default: 1000)
- **Per-agent limits**: Different agents can have different response limits
- **Runtime overrides**: Can be overridden per-call if needed

### Best practices

- Set limits based on your use case (summaries vs. detailed explanations)
- Consider user experience when responses are truncated
- Combine with input processors for comprehensive length control
- Monitor abort rates to adjust limits appropriately
- Implement graceful handling of aborted responses in your UI

### Use cases

- **Cost control**: Prevent unexpectedly expensive long responses
- **UI constraints**: Ensure responses fit within specific display areas
- **Quality control**: Encourage concise, focused answers
- **Performance**: Reduce latency for applications requiring quick responses
- **Rate limiting**: Control resource usage across multiple concurrent requests

This processor is particularly valuable for applications that need predictable response lengths, whether for cost management, user interface constraints, or maintaining consistent response quality.
