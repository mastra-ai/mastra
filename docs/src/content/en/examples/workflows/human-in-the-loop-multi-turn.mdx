# Multi-Turn Human in the Loop

Multi-turn human-in-the-loop workflows enable ongoing interaction between humans and AI agents, allowing for complex decision-making processes that require multiple rounds of input and response. These workflows can suspend execution at specific points, wait for human input, and continue processing based on the responses received.

In this example, the multi-turn workflow is used to create a Heads Up game that demonstrates how to create interactive workflows using suspend/resume functionality and conditional logic with `dountil` to repeat a workflow step until a specific condition is met.

This example consists of four main components:

1. A [**Famous Person Agent**](#famous-person-agent) that generates a famous person's name.
2. A [**Game Agent**](#game-agent) that handles the gameplay.
3. A [**Guess Verifier Agent**](#guess-verifier-agent) that validates responses.
4. A [**Multi-Turn Workflow**](#multi-turn-workflow) that orchestrates the interaction.

## Prerequisites

This example uses the `openai` model. Make sure to add the following to your `.env` file:

```bash filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=<your-api-key>
```

## Famous person agent

The `famousPersonAgent` generates a unique name each time the game is played, using semantic memory to avoid repeating suggestions.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/example-famous-person-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { LibSQLVector } from "@mastra/libsql";

export const famousPersonAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Famous Person Generator",
  instructions: `You are a famous person generator for a "Heads Up" guessing game.

Generate the name of a well-known famous person who:
- Is recognizable to most people
- Has distinctive characteristics that can be described with yes/no questions
- Is appropriate for all audiences
- Has a clear, unambiguous name

IMPORTANT: Use your memory to check what famous people you've already suggested and NEVER repeat a person you've already suggested.

Examples: Albert Einstein, BeyoncÃ©, Leonardo da Vinci, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jordan

Return only the person's name, nothing else.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o"),
  memory: new Memory({
    vector: new LibSQLVector({
      connectionUrl: "file:../mastra.db"
    }),
    embedder: openai.embedding("text-embedding-3-small"),
    options: {
      lastMessages: 5,
      semanticRecall: {
        topK: 10,
        messageRange: 1
      }
    }
  })
});
```

> See [Agent](../../reference/agents/agent.mdx) for a full list of configuration options.

## Game agent

The `gameAgent` handles user interactions by responding to questions and validating guesses.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/example-game-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const gameAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Game Agent",
  instructions: `You are a helpful game assistant for a "Heads Up" guessing game.

CRITICAL: You know the famous person's name but you must NEVER reveal it in any response.

When a user asks a question about the famous person:
- Answer truthfully based on the famous person provided
- Keep responses concise and friendly
- NEVER mention the person's name, even if it seems natural
- NEVER reveal gender, nationality, or other characteristics unless specifically asked about them
- Answer yes/no questions with clear "Yes" or "No" responses
- Be consistent - same question asked differently should get the same answer
- Ask for clarification if a question is unclear
- If multiple questions are asked at once, ask them to ask one at a time

When they make a guess:
- If correct: Congratulate them warmly
- If incorrect: Politely correct them and encourage them to try again

Encourage players to make a guess when they seem to have enough information.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o")
});
```

## Guess verifier agent

The `guessVerifierAgent` validates a user's guess.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/example-guess-verifier-agent.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";

export const guessVerifierAgent = new Agent({
  name: "Guess Verifier",
  instructions: `You are a guess verifier for a "Heads Up" guessing game.

Your job is to determine if a user's guess matches the actual famous person.

Consider:
- Exact name matches (e.g., "Albert Einstein" vs "Einstein")
- Common nicknames and variations
- Spelling variations and typos
- Partial matches that are clearly the same person

Return a JSON object with:
- isCorrect: true if the guess matches the person, false otherwise

Be strict but fair - only mark as correct if it's clearly the same person.`,
  model: openai("gpt-4o")
});
```

## Multi-turn workflow

The main workflow orchestrates the multi-turn interaction using suspend/resume functionality and conditional logic with `dountil` to repeat the `gameStep` until a specific condition is met.

The `startStep` uses the `famousPersonAgent`, the `gameStep` uses the `gameAgent` and `guessVerifierAgent` agents.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/workflows/example-heads-up-workflow.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { createWorkflow, createStep } from "@mastra/core/workflows";
import { z } from "zod";

const startStep = createStep({
  id: "start-step",
  description: "Generate a famous person's name",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    start: z.boolean()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  }),
  execute: async ({ mastra }) => {
    const agent = mastra.getAgent("famousPersonAgent");
    const response = await agent.generate("Generate a famous person's name", {
      temperature: 1.2,
      topP: 0.9,
      memory: {
        resource: "heads-up-game",
        thread: "famous-person-generator"
      }
    });
    const famousPerson = response.text.trim();
    return { famousPerson, guessCount: 0 };
  }
});

const gameStep = createStep({
  id: "game-step",
  description: "Handles the question-answer-continue loop",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  }),
  resumeSchema: z.object({
    userMessage: z.string()
  }),
  suspendSchema: z.object({
    agentResponse: z.string()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    gameWon: z.boolean(),
    agentResponse: z.string(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData, mastra, resumeData, suspend }) => {
    let { famousPerson, guessCount } = inputData;
    const { userMessage } = resumeData ?? {};

    if (!userMessage) {
      const message = "I'm thinking of a famous person. Ask me yes/no questions to figure out who it is!";

      await suspend({
        agentResponse: message
      });

      return { famousPerson, gameWon: false, agentResponse: message, guessCount };
    } else {
      const guessVerifier = mastra.getAgent("guessVerifierAgent");
      const verificationResponse = await guessVerifier.generate(
        [
          {
            role: "user",
            content: `Actual famous person: ${famousPerson}
              User's guess: "${userMessage}"
              Is this correct?`
          }
        ],
        {
          output: z.object({
            isCorrect: z.boolean()
          })
        }
      );

      const gameWon = verificationResponse.object.isCorrect;

      const agent = mastra.getAgent("gameAgent");
      const response = await agent.generate(`
      The famous person is: ${famousPerson}
      The user asked: "${userMessage}"
      Is this a correct guess: ${gameWon}
      Please respond appropriately.
    `);

      const agentResponse = response.text;

      guessCount++;

      return { famousPerson, gameWon, agentResponse, guessCount };
    }
  }
});

const winStep = createStep({
  id: "win-step",
  description: "Handle game win logic",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    gameWon: z.boolean(),
    agentResponse: z.string(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    gameWon: z.boolean(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  }),
  execute: async ({ inputData }) => {
    const { famousPerson, gameWon, guessCount } = inputData;

    return { famousPerson, gameWon, guessCount };
  }
});

export const headsUpWorkflow = createWorkflow({
  id: "heads-up-workflow",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    start: z.boolean()
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    famousPerson: z.string(),
    gameWon: z.boolean(),
    guessCount: z.number()
  })
})
  .then(startStep)
  .dountil(gameStep, async ({ inputData: { gameWon } }) => gameWon)
  .then(winStep)
  .commit();
```

## Registering the agents and workflow

All three agents and the workflow are registered in the main Mastra instance so they can be accessed by each other.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/index.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core/mastra";

import { headsUpWorkflow } from "./workflows/example-heads-up-workflow";
import { famousPersonAgent } from "./agents/example-famous-person-agent";
import { gameAgent } from "./agents/example-game-agent";
import { guessVerifierAgent } from "./agents/example-guess-verifier-agent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  workflows: { headsUpWorkflow },
  agents: { famousPersonAgent, gameAgent, guessVerifierAgent }
});
```
