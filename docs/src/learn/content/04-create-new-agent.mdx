## Build your own agent

Now you create the agent you'll keep extending for the rest of the course. Create a new file at `src/mastra/agents/companion.ts`:

```ts
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent'
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai'

export const companion = new Agent({
  name: 'companion',
  instructions: `You are a friendly theme park companion. You help visitors plan their day, find attractions, and make the most of their visit.

When a visitor asks for help:
1. Ask which park they are visiting if you don't know
2. Suggest activities based on what you know
3. Be enthusiastic but concise`,
  model: openai('gpt-4o'),
})
```

## What controls behavior

Three things shape what your agent does:

- **Instructions** — the system prompt that defines personality, process, and boundaries
- **Model** — which LLM to use and its configuration
- **Tools** — capabilities you attach later so the agent can take real actions

For now, the agent has instructions and a model but no tools. It can chat, but it can't look anything up or take actions yet. We'll add tools in the next lesson.

## Register and run

Add the agent to your Mastra instance in `src/mastra/index.ts`:

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { weatherAgent } from './agents'
import { companion } from './agents/companion'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent, companion },
})
```

Restart the dev server and open Studio. Your new "companion" agent appears in the sidebar. Chat with it — it responds, but it's working from instructions alone.

## Your first trace

Open **Traces** in Studio after a conversation. This is where you'll debug everything for the rest of the course. Right now the trace is simple — just a model call and response. As we add tools, workflows, and memory, the trace gets richer and more useful.
