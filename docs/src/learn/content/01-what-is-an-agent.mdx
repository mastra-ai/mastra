## Agent vs. chatbot

A chatbot takes your message and responds — one turn, no tools, no autonomy. An **agent** goes further: it observes context, reasons about what to do, selects tools, takes actions, and loops until the task is done.

Think of it as the difference between asking someone a question and hiring someone to complete a project. The question gets you an answer; the agent gets you a result.

## The core building blocks

Mastra gives you a structured way to build agents. Here's the high-level picture:

- **Agents** — the autonomous decision-makers that receive goals and figure out how to achieve them
- **Tools** — functions agents can call to interact with the real world (APIs, databases, search)
- **Workflows** — predefined multi-step processes for repeatable tasks
- **Memory** — persistent context so agents remember past conversations
- **Retrieval (RAG)** — knowledge bases agents can search for relevant information
- **Observability** — traces and scoring so you can see exactly what happened and measure quality

## What we're building

Throughout this course, we'll build a **Theme Park Companion Agent** — a conversational assistant that can:

- Look up theme parks and pull live wait times
- Suggest activities based on current conditions
- Handle multi-step workflows like ticket purchases with approval gates
- Remember user preferences across conversations

The project is intentionally small and beginner-friendly. The exact features are less important than the Mastra concepts they teach — and those concepts transfer directly to whatever you build next.

## Why Mastra?

Mastra is a TypeScript framework purpose-built for AI agents. It handles the agent loop, tool execution, memory management, workflow orchestration, and streaming — you focus on the behavior you want.

Everything runs locally in **Mastra Studio** during development, so you can iterate fast: change code, restart, test, inspect traces, repeat.
