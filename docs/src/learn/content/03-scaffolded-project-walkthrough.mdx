## Project structure

After scaffolding, your project looks like this:

```
my-project/
├── src/
│   └── mastra/
│       ├── index.ts        # Mastra instance — the entry point
│       ├── agents/
│       │   └── index.ts    # Agent definitions
│       ├── tools/
│       │   └── index.ts    # Tool definitions
│       └── workflows/
│           └── index.ts    # Workflow definitions
├── .env                    # API keys and secrets
├── package.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

The scaffolded project includes a **Weather agent** with a weather tool and a simple workflow. Let's use those as a reference point to understand how the pieces connect.

## The Mastra instance

`src/mastra/index.ts` is the entry point you keep coming back to. It creates a `Mastra` instance and registers everything:

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core'
import { weatherAgent } from './agents'

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
})
```

This is where dependency injection happens. Agents, tools, memory, storage, and workflows all register here.

## Agents, tools, and workflows

Each lives in its own folder under `src/mastra/`:

- **Agents** (`agents/index.ts`) — define name, instructions (system prompt), model, and optionally tools
- **Tools** (`tools/index.ts`) — define ID, description, input schema, and execute function
- **Workflows** (`workflows/index.ts`) — define steps with inputs, outputs, and transitions

## Mapping Studio to source files

What you see in Studio maps directly to these folders:

| Studio section | Source folder |
|---|---|
| Agents | `src/mastra/agents/` |
| Tools | `src/mastra/tools/` |
| Workflows | `src/mastra/workflows/` |
| Traces | Generated from runs — no source file |

When you edit a file and restart the dev server, Studio reflects the change. This is the mental map you'll use for the rest of the course.
