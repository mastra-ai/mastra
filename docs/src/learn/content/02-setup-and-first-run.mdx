## How people start with Mastra

There are three main paths:

1. **Integrate with your framework** — add Mastra to an existing project, then call agents and workflows from your app's routes or server logic
2. **Scaffold a new project** — use `create-mastra` to generate a runnable example you can adapt
3. **Start from a template** — use a pre-built starting point when you already have a use case in mind

This course takes path 2: we'll scaffold a project and iterate entirely in **Mastra Studio** before worrying about UI integration.

## Scaffold and run

```bash
npx create-mastra@latest my-project
cd my-project
pnpm install
```

Add your LLM provider key to `.env`:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

Then start the dev server:

```bash
pnpm dev
```

## Meet Mastra Studio

Studio opens at `http://localhost:4111`. It's an interactive UI for building and testing agents — plus a local REST API that exposes your Mastra app as a service.

The key areas:

- **Agents** — chat with your agents, adjust settings, test prompts
- **Tools** — run tools in isolation to verify inputs and outputs
- **Workflows** — execute step-by-step runs and inspect each step
- **Traces** — see exactly what happened: model calls, tool executions, errors

Studio is your development environment. It's where you'll iterate for the rest of this course. It is _not_ the thing you ship to end users — that comes later when we talk about deployment.

## The local dev loop

The workflow you'll repeat throughout this course:

1. Change code (agent instructions, tools, workflows)
2. Restart the dev server
3. Test in Studio
4. Inspect traces to understand what happened
5. Repeat
