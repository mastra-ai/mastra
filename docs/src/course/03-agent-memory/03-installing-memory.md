# Installing Memory

Let's start by installing the Mastra memory package:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory
```

The `@mastra/memory` package provides all the functionality you need to add memory capabilities to your Mastra agents. It includes support for conversation history, semantic recall, and working memory.

This package is separate from the core Mastra package, allowing you to only include it when you need memory capabilities in your project. This modular approach helps keep your project dependencies lean when you don't need all features.
