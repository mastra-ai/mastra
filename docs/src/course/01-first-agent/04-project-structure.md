# Verifying Project Structure

Let's check that your project has the correct structure. You should have:

1. A `src/mastra` directory that contains:
   - `index.ts` - The main entry point for your Mastra project
   - `agents/index.ts` - Where your agents are defined
   - `tools/index.ts` - Where your tools are defined

If these files exist, you're ready to start building your agent!

This structure is important because it follows the Mastra convention for organizing your code. The `index.ts` file is the main entry point for your Mastra project, while the `agents` and `tools` directories contain the definitions for your agents and tools, respectively.
