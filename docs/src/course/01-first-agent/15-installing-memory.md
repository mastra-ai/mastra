# Installing Memory

First, we need to install the Mastra memory package to add memory capabilities to our agent. Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory
```

The `@mastra/memory` package provides a simple yet powerful memory system for your Mastra agents. It allows your agent to remember previous conversations and maintain context across multiple interactions.

This package is separate from the core Mastra package to keep the framework modular and allow you to only include the features you need in your project.
