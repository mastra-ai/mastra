# Agent Memory

Agents in Mastra have a memory that stores conversation history and contextual information. This memory allows agents to maintain state across interactions, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.

There are two main ways to implement agent memory in Mastra:

1. **Using KV Upstash**
2. **Using External Storage (Redis or PostgreSQL)**

## 1. Using KV Upstash

KV Upstash provides a serverless Redis-compatible key-value store that's perfect for agent memory storage. Here's how to set it up:

First, install the necessary package:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory
```

Create an Upstash account and database:

1. Go to https://upstash.com/ and sign up for an account
2. Create a new database in your preferred region
3. Copy your REST URL and TOKEN from the database details page

Then, configure your agent to use Upstash KV:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { UpstashKVMemory } from "@mastra/memory";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create UpstashKVMemory
const upstashKVMemory = new UpstashKVMemory({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: upstashKVMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Add your Upstash credentials to your environment variables:

```env
# .env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token
```

## 2. Using External Storage

For production environments where you need persistent memory across restarts and scalability, you can use a external storage backend like PostgreSQL.

### Using PostgreSQL for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory
```

Then, configure your agent to use PostgreSQL for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PostgresMemory } from "@mastra/memory";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a PgMemory using connectionString
const pgMemory = new PgMemory({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: pgMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Ensure you have your PostgreSQL connection string set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database
```

## Managing Agent Memory

Once your agent is configured with a memory backend, you can manage its memory using the following methods.

### Creating a Thread

First, create a new conversation thread for your agent:

```typescript
const thread = await mastra.memory.createThread({
  resourceId: "memory_id"
});
```

This creates a new thread and assigns it a unique identifier. The `resourceId` parameter helps identify which memory context this thread belongs to.

### Save Messages on Generate

Generate responses while maintaining conversation context. 
The `threadId` parameter links messages to a specific conversation thread, while `resourceId` associates the conversation with a particular memory context or resource:

```typescript
const responseOne = await myAgent.generate("Tell me about the project requirements.", {
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  threadId: thread.id,
});

const responseTwo = await myAgent.generate("What are the next steps?", {
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  threadId: thread.id,
});
```
Each generate call automatically preserves the conversation context in memory.

### Saving Messages to Memory

You can explicitly save messages to the thread from the agent.

```typescript
await myAgent.saveMemory({
  threadId: thread.id,
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  userMessages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What are the main performance bottlenecks?",
    },
  ],
});
```

This method enables you to manually preserve specific messages in the thread's memory. 

### Retrieving Messages From Memory

To check the current messages in memory at any point:

```typescript
const messages = await mastra.memory.getMessages({
  threadId: thread.id,
});
```

Retrieves all messages from the specified thread in chronological order.

### Retrieving Context Window

You can use memory to retrieve messages within a specific time range:

```typescript
const messages = await mastra.memory.getContextWindow({
  threadId: thread.id,
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  format: 'raw'
});
```

You can optionally limit the total tokens in the context window by configuring maxTokens in your memory:

```typescript
const upstashKVMemory = new UpstashKVMemory({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN!,
  maxTokens: 4000 // Limit total tokens in context window
});
```

When maxTokens is set, messages are filtered by date range and then processed from newest to oldest until the token limit is reached. 
This maintains the context window size while preserving the most recent conversation history.

### Deleting a Thread

To remove a thread and all its associated messages:

```typescript
await mastra.memory.deleteThread(thread.id);
```

Permanently deletes the thread and its messages.
