# Control Flow in Workflows

When you create a multi-step process, you may need to run steps in parallel, chain them sequentially, or follow different paths based on outcomes. This page describes how you can manage branching, merging, and conditions to construct workflows that meet your logic requirements. The code snippets show the key patterns for structuring complex control flow.

## Parallel Execution

You can run multiple steps at the same time if they don’t depend on each other. This approach can speed up your workflow when steps perform independent tasks. The code below shows how to add two steps in parallel:

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(fetchUserData).step(fetchOrderData);
```

See the [Parallel Steps](../../examples/workflows/parallel-steps.mdx) example for more details.

## Sequential Execution

Sometimes you need to run steps in strict order to ensure outputs from one step become inputs for the next. Use .then() to link dependent operations. The code below shows how to chain steps sequentially:

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(fetchOrderData).then(validateData).then(processOrder);
```

See the [Sequential Steps](../../examples/workflows/sequential-steps.mdx) example for more details.

## Branching and Merging Paths

When different outcomes require different paths, branching is helpful. You can also merge paths later once they complete. The code below shows how to branch after stepA and later converge on stepF:

```typescript
myWorkflow
  .step(stepA)
    .then(stepB)
    .then(stepD)
  .after(stepA)
    .step(stepC)
    .then(stepE)
  .after([stepD, stepE])
    .step(stepF);
```

In this example:

- stepA leads to stepB, then to stepD.  
- Separately, stepA also triggers stepC, which in turn leads to stepE.  
- The workflow waits for both stepD and stepE to finish before proceeding to stepF.

See the [Branching Paths](../../examples/workflows/branching-paths.mdx) example for more details.

## Cyclical Dependencies

You can loop back to earlier steps based on conditions, allowing you to repeat tasks until certain results are achieved. The code below shows a workflow that repeats fetchData when a status is “retry”:

```typescript
myWorkflow
  .step(fetchData)
  .then(processData)
  .after(processData)
  .step(finalizeData, {
    when: { "processData.status": "success" },
  })
  .step(fetchData, {
    when: { "processData.status": "retry" },
  });
```

If processData returns “success,” finalizeData runs. If it returns “retry,” the workflow loops back to fetchData.

See the [Cyclical Dependencies](../../examples/workflows/cyclical-dependencies.mdx) example for more details.

## Conditions

Use the when property to control whether a step runs based on data from previous steps. Below are three ways to specify conditions.

### Option 1: Function

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: async ({ context }) => {
      const fetchData = context?.getStepPayload<{ status: string }>("fetchData");
      return fetchData?.status === "success";
    },
  },
);
```

### Option 2: Query Object

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: {
      ref: {
        step: {
          id: "fetchData",
        },
        path: "status",
      },
      query: { $eq: "success" },
    },
  },
);
```

### Option 3: Simple Path Comparison

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(
  new Step({
    id: "processData",
    execute: async ({ context }) => {
      // Action logic
    },
  }),
  {
    when: {
      "fetchData.status": "success",
    },
  },
);
```

## Renaming Variables

Variables let you pass outputs from one step into another step’s inputs.

### Passing Trigger Data

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo, {
  variables: {
    valueToIncrement: {
      step: "trigger",
      path: "inputValue",
    },
  },
});
```

### Passing Output from a Previous Step

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo, {
  variables: {
    valueToIncrement: {
      step: stepOne,
      path: "doubledValue",
    },
  },
});
```

### Passing Output Using a Step ID

```typescript
myWorkflow.step(stepOne).then(stepTwo, {
  variables: {
    valueToIncrement: {
      step: {
        id: "stepOne",
      },
      path: "doubledValue",
    },
  },
});
```

In all these examples, you pick the specific data you want to pass forward. This approach helps decouple steps and keep your workflow logic clear.
