# Create your own Eval

Creating your own eval is as easy as creating a new function. You simply create a class that extends the `Metric` class and implement the `measure` method. 


## Basic example 

Here is a very basic example of a custom eval that checks if the output contains a certain keyword. This is a simplified version of our own [keyword coverage eval](/docs/reference/evals/keyword-coverage).


```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/evals/keyword-coverage.ts"
import { Metric, type MetricResult } from '@mastra/core/eval';
import keyword_extractor from 'keyword-extractor';

interface KeywordCoverageResult extends MetricResult {
  info: {
    totalKeywords: number;
    matchedKeywords: number;
  };
}

export class KeywordCoverageMetric extends Metric {
  private referenceKeywords: Set<string>;

  constructor(keywords: string[]) {
    super();
    this.referenceKeywords = new Set(this.keywords);
  }

  async measure(input: string, output: string): Promise<KeywordCoverageResult> {
    // Handle empty strings case
    if (!input && !output) {
      return {
        score: 1,
        info: {
          totalKeywords: 0,
          matchedKeywords: 0,
        },
      };
    }

    const matchedKeywords = [...this.referenceKeywords].filter(k => output.includes(k));
    const totalKeywords = this.referenceKeywords.size;
    const coverage = totalKeywords > 0 ? matchedKeywords.length / totalKeywords : 0;

    return {
      score: coverage,
      info: {
        totalKeywords: referenceKeywords.size,
        matchedKeywords: matchedKeywords.length,
      },
    };
  }
}
```

## Creating a custom LLM-Judge

A custom LLM judge can provide more targeted and meaningful evaluations for your use case. For example, if you're building a medical Q&A system, you might want to evaluate not just answer relevancy but also medical accuracy and safety considerations.

Let's create an example to make sure our [Chef Michel](/docs/guides/01-chef-michel) is not breaking any dietary preferences of the user.

We'll start with creating the judge agent. You can put it all in one file but we prefer splitting it into a separate file to keep things readable.

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/evals/dietary-preferences-judge.ts"
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { type LanguageModel } from '@mastra/core/llm';
import { z } from 'zod';

import { MastraAgentJudge } from '../../judge';

import {
  generateClaimExtractionPrompt,
  generateEvaluatePrompt,
  FAITHFULNESS_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS,
  generateReasonPrompt,
} from './prompts';

export class DietaryPreferencesJudge {
  private agent: Agent;

  constructor(model: LanguageModel) {
    this.agent = new Agent({
      name: `Mastra Eval Dietary Preferences Judge`,
    instructions: `You are a Master Chef that acts as a food judge. If any dietary preferences are mentioned in the user's input, you need to check if the recipe contains any ingredients that are forbidden or preferred by the user.`,
      model,
    });
  }

  async evaluate(input: string, output: string): Promise<{ claim: string; verdict: string; reason: string }[]> {
    const validateDietaryPreferencesPrompt = `Based on the user's input, check if the recipe contains any ingredients that are forbidden or preferred by the user.

Here are some things you need to consider:
- The user might not mention any dietary preferences, in that case you should return an empty array.
- The user might mention specific ingredients that are forbidden or preferred, in that case you should return an array with the ingredient and the verdict.

Examples:
- User input: "I am a vegetarian, so I cannot eat any meat."
- Recipe: "1lb of beef"
- Verdict: "Forbidden"

- User input: "I am a vegan, so I cannot eat any meat or dairy products."
- Recipe: "1 cup of milk"
- Verdict: "Forbidden"

user input: ${input}

recipe: ${output}
`
    const result = await this.agent.generate(validateDietaryPreferencesPrompt, {
      output: z.object({
        ingredients: z.array(z.string()),
        verdict: z.string(),
      }),
    });

    return result.object;
  }

  async getReason(args: {
    input: string;
    output: string;
    score: number;
    scale: number;
    verdict: { verdict: string; ingredients: string[] }[];
  }): Promise<string> {
    const prompt = `Explain why the recipe with the ingredients ${args.verdict.ingredients.join(', ')} is ${args.verdict.verdict} according to the user's input: ${args.input}
    
Here is the recipe: ${args.output}`;
    const result = await this.agent.generate(prompt, {
      output: z.object({
        reason: z.string(),
      }),
    });
    return result.object.reason;
  }
}
```

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/evals/dietary-preferences.ts"
import { Metric } from '@mastra/core/eval';
import { DietaryPreferencesJudge } from './dietary-preferences-judge';
import { type LanguageModel } from '@mastra/core/llm';

export interface DietaryPreferencesMetricOptions {
  scale?: number;
}

export class DietaryPreferencesMetric extends Metric {
  private judge: Agent;
  private scale: number;
  constructor(model: LanguageModel, { scale = 1 }: DietaryPreferencesMetricOptions) {
    super();

    this.judge = new DietaryPreferencesJudge(model);
    this.scale = scale;
  }

  async measure(input: string, output: string): Promise<MetricResultWithReason> {
    const verdict = await this.judge.evaluate(input, output);
    const score = this.calculateScore(verdicts);
    const reason = await this.judge.getReason({
      input,
      output,
      score,
      scale: this.scale,
      verdict,
    });

    return {
      score,
      info: {
        ingredients: verdict.ingredients,
        reason,
      },
    };
  }

  private calculateScore(verdict: { verdict: string; }): number {
    return verdict.verdict.toLowerCase() === 'forbidden' ? 0 : 1;
  }
}
```

You can now use the `DietaryPreferencesMetric` in your project. [See the full example here](/docs/guides/01-chef-michel).

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/agents/chefAgent.ts"
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { DietaryPreferencesMetric } from "../evals/dietary-preferences";
export const chefAgent = new Agent({
  name: "chef-agent",
  instructions:
    "You are Michel, a practical and experienced home chef" +
    "You helps people cook with whatever ingredients they have available.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  evals: [new DietaryPreferencesMetric(openai("gpt-4o-mini"))],
});
```
