# Deploying Mastra to the Cloud

In this guide, we'll cover how to deploy your Mastra agents and workflows using deployers. Mastra provides dedicated deployers for various cloud platforms, making it easy to deploy your agents with minimal configuration.

Currently, Mastra supports deploying to:
- **Cloudflare Workers**
- **Vercel**
- **Netlify**

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

- **Node.js** installed (version 18 or higher is recommended)
- An account with your chosen deployment platform (Cloudflare, Vercel, or Netlify)
- Required API keys or credentials for your deployment platform

## Using Deployers

Mastra uses a deployer-based system for cloud deployments. Each deployer is available as a separate package that you can install based on your needs.

### Installing Deployers

Install the deployer package for your chosen platform:

```bash copy
# For Cloudflare
npm install @mastra/deployer-cloudflare

# For Vercel
npm install @mastra/deployer-vercel

# For Netlify
npm install @mastra/deployer-netlify
```

### Configuring Deployers

Configure your Mastra instance with the appropriate deployer in your entry file:

```typescript:src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra, createLogger } from '@mastra/core';

// Import the deployer you want to use
import { CloudflareDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-cloudflare';
// OR
import { VercelDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-vercel';
// OR
import { NetlifyDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-netlify';

// Example with Cloudflare deployer
export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { /* your agents here */ },
  logger: createLogger({ name: 'MyApp', level: 'debug' }),
  deployer: new CloudflareDeployer({
    scope: 'your-cloudflare-scope',
    projectName: 'your-project-name',
  }),
});
```

### Deployer Configuration Options

#### Cloudflare Deployer

```typescript
new CloudflareDeployer({
  scope: 'your-cloudflare-scope',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
})
```

#### Vercel Deployer

```typescript
new VercelDeployer({
  scope: 'your-vercel-scope',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
})
```

#### Netlify Deployer

```typescript
new NetlifyDeployer({
  scope: 'your-netlify-scope',
  projectName: 'your-project-name',
})
```

## Environment Variables

Ensure you set up the necessary environment variables for:

1. Your deployment platform credentials
2. Any API keys needed by your agents (e.g., `OPENAI_API_KEY`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`)

You can set these variables through your deployment platform's dashboard or configuration files.

## Conclusion

By using Mastra's deployer system, you can easily deploy your agents to your preferred cloud platform. The deployers handle the complexities of deployment, allowing you to focus on building your agents and workflows.

For platform-specific deployment details or troubleshooting, refer to the respective platform's documentation:
