# Agent Tool Selection

Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.

## Creating Tools

In this section, we'll walk through the process of creating a tool that can be used by your agents. Let's create a simple tool that fetches current weather information for a given city.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts" copy
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core/tools";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`).then(
    (r) => r.json(),
  );
  return data;
};

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  id: "Get Weather Information",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ context: { city } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(city);
  },
});
```

## Adding Tools to an Agent

Now we'll add the tool to an agent. We'll create an agent that can answer questions about the weather and configure it to use our `weatherInfo` tool.

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";
import * as tools from "../tools/weatherInfo";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent<typeof tools>({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current weather information. When asked about the weather, use the weather information tool to fetch the data.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: {
    weatherInfo: tools.weatherInfo,
  },
});
```

## Registering the Agent

We need to initialize Mastra with our agent.

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weatherAgent";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  agents: { weatherAgent },
});
```

This registers your agent with Mastra, making it available for use.

## Debugging Tools

You can test tools using Vitest or any other testing framework. Writing unit tests for your tools ensures they behave as expected and helps catch errors early.

## Calling an Agent with a Tool

Now we can call the agent, and it will use the tool to fetch the weather information.

## Example: Interacting with the Agent

```typescript filename="src/index.ts"
import { mastra } from "./index";

async function main() {
  const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const response = await agent.generate(
    "What's the weather like in New York City today?",
  );

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

The agent will use the `weatherInfo` tool to get the current weather in New York City and respond accordingly.
