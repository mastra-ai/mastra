# Using MCP With Mastra

[Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/introduction) is a standardized way for AI models to discover and interact with external tools and resources.

## Overview

MCP in Mastra provides a standardized way to connect to tool servers and supports both stdio and SSE-based connections.

## Installation

Using pnpm:

```bash
pnpm add @mastra/mcp@latest
```

Using npm:

```bash
npm install @mastra/mcp@latest
```

## Using MCP in Your Code

The `MCPConfiguration` class provides a clean way to manage multiple tool servers in your Mastra applications. You can configure both stdio-based and SSE-based servers:

```typescript
import { MCPConfiguration } from "@mastra/mcp";
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai";

const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    // stdio example
    sequential: {
      name: "sequential-thinking",
      server: {
        command: "npx",
        args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
      },
    },
    // SSE example
    weather: {
      url: new URL("http://localhost:8080/sse"),
      requestInit: {
        headers: {
          Authorization: "Bearer your-token",
        },
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Tools vs Toolsets

The `MCPConfiguration` class provides two ways to access MCP tools, each suited for different use cases:

#### Using Tools (`getTools()`)

Use this approach when:

- You have a single MCP connection
- The tools are used by a single user/context
- Tool configuration (API keys, credentials) remains constant
- You want to initialize an Agent with a fixed set of tools

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "CLI Assistant",
  instructions: "You help users with CLI tasks",
  model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
  tools: await mcp.getTools(), // Tools are fixed at agent creation
});
```

#### Using Toolsets (`getToolsets()`)

Use this approach when:

- You need per-request tool configuration
- Tools need different credentials per user
- Running in a multi-user environment (web app, API, etc)
- Tool configuration needs to change dynamically

```typescript
const mcp = new MCPConfiguration({
  servers: {
    stockPrice: {
      command: "npx",
      args: ["tsx", "stock-price.ts"],
      env: {
        API_KEY: "your-api-key",
      },
    },
  },
});

// Get the current toolsets configured for this user
const toolsets = await mcp.getToolsets();

// Use the agent with user-specific tool configurations
const response = await agent.stream(
  "What's new in Mastra and how's the weather?",
  {
    toolsets,
  },
);
```
