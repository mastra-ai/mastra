# Agent Memory

Agents in Mastra have a memory that stores conversation history and contextual information. This memory allows agents to maintain state across interactions, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.

## Using Agent Memory

Agent memory in Mastra is configured with two named parameters:
- `threadId` - A unique identifier for the conversation thread.
- `resourceId` - A unique identifier for the agent's memory context. This is used to group and manage memory for different agents or resources. You can also just set it to `default` for all agents if you don't need to group threads.

You can currently store agent memory in (Postgres)[#using-postgres-for-agent-memory] or (UpstashKV)[#using-redis-for-agent-memory].

First, create a new conversation thread:

```typescript
const thread = await mastra.memory.createThread({
  resourceId: "memory_id"
});
```

Now, let's start adding messages to the thread:

```typescript
const responseOne = await myAgent.generate("Tell me about the project requirements.", {
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  threadId: thread.id,
});

const responseTwo = await myAgent.generate("What are the next steps?", {
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  threadId: thread.id,
});
```

Notice that you don't need to explicitly save the messages to memory, or pass the response from the first call to the second. 

Each generate call automatically preserves the conversation context in memory. 

### Inserting Messages to Memory

You can also explicitly insert messages to the thread.

```typescript
await myAgent.saveMemory({
  threadId: thread.id,
  resourceId: "memory_id",
  userMessages: [
    {
      role: "user",
      content: "What are the main performance bottlenecks?",
    },
  ],
});
```

### Retrieving Messages From Memory

To check the current messages in memory at any point:

```typescript
const messages = await mastra.memory.getMessages({
  threadId: thread.id,
});
```

### Retrieving Messages From Memory

To check the current messages in memory at any point:

```typescript
const messages = await mastra.memory.getMessages({
  threadId: thread.id,
});
```

Retrieves all messages from the specified thread in chronological order.

### Retrieving Context Window

You can use memory to retrieve messages within a specific time range:

```typescript
const messages = await mastra.memory.getContextWindow({
  threadId: thread.id,
  startDate: new Date('2024-01-01'),
  endDate: new Date('2024-01-31'),
  format: 'raw'
});
```

You can optionally limit the total tokens in the context window by configuring maxTokens in your memory:

```typescript
const upstashKVMemory = new UpstashKVMemory({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN!,
  maxTokens: 4000 // Limit total tokens in context window
});
```

When maxTokens is set, messages are filtered by date range and then processed from newest to oldest until the token limit is reached. 

This maintains the context window size while preserving the most recent conversation history.

### Deleting a Thread

To remove a thread and all its associated messages:

```typescript
await mastra.memory.deleteThread(thread.id);
```

## Persisting Memory to a Backend

We currently have two drivers for agent memory in Mastra, Postgres and Redis.

### Using Postgres for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/memory
```

Then, configure your agent to use PostgreSQL for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PgMemory } from "@mastra/memory";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a PgMemory using connectionString
const pgMemory = new PgMemory({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: pgMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Ensure you have your PostgreSQL connection string set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database
```

### Using Redis for Agent Memory

KV Upstash provides a serverless Redis-compatible key-value store that's perfect for agent memory storage. Here's how to set it up:

First, install the necessary package:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory
```

Create an Upstash account and database:

1. Go to https://upstash.com/ and sign up for an account
2. Create a new database in your preferred region
3. Copy your REST URL and TOKEN from the database details page

Then, configure your agent to use Upstash KV:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { UpstashKVMemory } from "@mastra/memory";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create UpstashKVMemory
const upstashKVMemory = new UpstashKVMemory({
  url: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL!,
  token: process.env.UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: upstashKVMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Add your Upstash credentials to your environment variables:

```env
# .env
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_URL=https://your-url.upstash.io
UPSTASH_REDIS_REST_TOKEN=your_token
```
