# ContextPositionMetric

The `ContextPositionMetric` class evaluates how well context nodes are ordered based on their relevance to the query and output. It uses position-weighted scoring to emphasize the importance of having the most relevant context pieces appear earlier in the sequence.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ContextPositionMetric } from "@mastra/evals";

// Configure the model for evaluation
const model = {
  provider: "OPEN_AI",
  name: "gpt-4",
  apiKey: process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY
};

const metric = new ContextPositionMetric(model, {
  scale: 1
});

const result = await metric.measure({
  input: "What is photosynthesis?",
  output: "Photosynthesis is the process by which plants convert sunlight into energy.",
  context: [
    "Photosynthesis is a biological process used by plants to create energy from sunlight.",
    "The process of photosynthesis produces oxygen as a byproduct.",
    "Plants need water and nutrients from the soil to grow."
  ]
});

console.log(result.score); // Position score from 0-1
console.log(result.reason); // Explanation of the score
```

## Scoring Details

The metric evaluates context positioning through:
- Individual assessment of each context piece's relevance
- Position-based weighting (1/position)
- Binary relevance verdicts (yes/no) with detailed reasoning
- Normalization against optimal ordering

The scoring process:
1. Evaluates relevance of each context piece
2. Applies position weights (earlier positions weighted more heavily)
3. Sums weighted relevance scores
4. Normalizes against maximum possible score
5. Scales to configured range (default 0-1)

Score interpretation:
- 1.0: Most relevant context at the beginning, optimal ordering
- 0.7-0.9: Relevant context mostly at the beginning
- 0.4-0.6: Mixed ordering of relevant context
- 0.1-0.3: Relevant context mostly at the end
- 0: No relevant context or worst possible ordering

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
const metric = new ContextPositionMetric(model);

const result = await metric.measure({
  input: "What are the benefits of exercise?",
  output: "Regular exercise improves cardiovascular health and mental wellbeing.",
  context: [
    "A balanced diet is important for health.",
    "Exercise strengthens the heart and improves blood circulation.",
    "Regular physical activity reduces stress and anxiety.",
    "Exercise equipment can be expensive."
  ]
});

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.5,
//   reason: "The score is 0.5 because while the second and third contexts are highly 
//           relevant to the benefits of exercise, they are not optimally positioned at 
//           the beginning of the sequence. The first and last contexts are not relevant 
//           to the query, which impacts the position-weighted scoring."
// }
```
