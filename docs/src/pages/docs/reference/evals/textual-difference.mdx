# TextualDifferenceMetric

The `TextualDifferenceMetric` class measures the textual differences between two strings using sequence matching. It provides detailed information about changes, including the number of operations needed to transform one text into another.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { TextualDifferenceMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const result = await metric.measure({
  input: "The quick brown fox",
  output: "The fast brown fox"
});

console.log(result.score); // Similarity ratio from 0-1
console.log(result.details); // Description of differences
console.log(result.metrics); // Detailed change metrics
```

## measure() Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string",
      description: "The original text to compare against",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "string",
      description: "The text to evaluate for differences",
      isOptional: false,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description: "Similarity ratio (0-1) where 1 indicates identical texts",
    },
    {
      name: "details",
      type: "string",
      description: "Human-readable description of differences including number of changes",
    },
    {
      name: "confidence",
      type: "number",
      description: "Confidence score based on length difference between texts (0-1)",
    },
    {
      name: "metrics",
      type: "object",
      description: "Detailed metrics about the differences",
    }
  ]}
/>

### metrics Object

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "ratio",
      type: "number",
      description: "Raw similarity ratio between the texts",
    },
    {
      name: "changes",
      type: "number",
      description: "Number of change operations (insertions, deletions, replacements)",
    },
    {
      name: "lengthDiff",
      type: "number",
      description: "Normalized difference in length between input and output (0-1)",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Scoring Details

The metric calculates several measures:
- **Similarity Ratio**: Based on sequence matching between texts (0-1)
- **Changes**: Count of non-matching operations needed
- **Length Difference**: Normalized difference in text lengths
- **Confidence**: Inversely proportional to length difference

The scoring process:
1. Performs sequence matching between input and output
2. Counts number of change operations required
3. Calculates length-based confidence
4. Returns detailed metrics for analysis

## Example with Analysis

```typescript
const metric = new TextualDifferenceMetric();

const result = await metric.measure({
  input: "Hello world! How are you?",
  output: "Hello there! How is it going?"
});

// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.65,
//   details: "Difference score: 65.0% with 2 changes",
//   confidence: 0.95,
//   metrics: {
//     ratio: 0.65,
//     changes: 2,
//     lengthDiff: 0.05
//   }
// }
```
