# ToneConsistencyMetric

The `ToneConsistencyMetric` class evaluates the text's emotional tone and sentiment consistency.  It can operate in two modes: comparing tone between input/output pairs or analyzing tone stability within a single text.

## Basic Usage

```typescript
import { ToneConsistencyMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new ToneConsistencyMetric();

// Compare tone between input and output
const result1 = await metric.measure(
  "I love this amazing product!",
  "This product is wonderful and fantastic!"
);

// Analyze tone stability in a single text
const result2 = await metric.measure(
  "The service is excellent. The staff is friendly. The atmosphere is perfect.",
  ""  // Empty string for single-text analysis
);

console.log(result1.score); // Tone consistency score from 0-1
console.log(result2.score); // Tone stability score from 0-1
```

## measure() Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "input",
      type: "string",
      description: "The text to analyze for tone",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "output",
      type: "string",
      description: "Reference text for tone comparison (empty string for stability analysis)",
      isOptional: false,
    }
  ]}
/>

## Returns

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "score",
      type: "number",
      description: "Tone consistency/stability score (0-1)",
    },
    {
      name: "info",
      type: "object",
      description: "Detailed tone info",
    }
  ]}
/>

### info Object (Tone Comparison)

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "responseSentiment",
      type: "number",
      description: "Sentiment score for the input text",
    },
    {
      name: "referenceSentiment",
      type: "number",
      description: "Sentiment score for the output text",
    },
    {
      name: "difference",
      type: "number",
      description: "Absolute difference between sentiment scores",
    }
  ]}
/>

### info Object (Tone Stability)

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "avgSentiment",
      type: "number",
      description: "Average sentiment score across sentences",
    },
    {
      name: "sentimentVariance",
      type: "number",
      description: "Variance in sentiment between sentences",
    }
  ]}
/>

## Modes of Operation

### 1. Tone Consistency (with reference)
When both input and output are provided:
- Compares sentiment between the two texts
- Calculates sentiment difference
- Higher score indicates a more consistent tone

### 2. Tone Stability (single input)
When output is empty:
- Analyzes sentiment stability across sentences
- Calculates variance in sentiment
- Higher score indicates a more stable tone

## Scoring Details

The metric calculates several measures:
- **Similarity Ratio**: Based on sequence matching between texts (0-1)
- **Changes**: Count of non-matching operations needed
- **Length Difference**: Normalized difference in text lengths
- **Confidence**: Inversely proportional to length difference

The scoring process:
1. Performs sequence matching between input and output
2. Counts the number of change operations required
3. Calculates length-based confidence
4. Returns detailed metrics for analysis

Score interpretation (0 to scale, default 0-1):
- 1.0: Perfect summary - completely factual and covers all key information
- 0.7-0.9: Strong summary with minor omissions or slight inaccuracies
- 0.4-0.6: Moderate quality with significant gaps or inaccuracies
- 0.1-0.3: Poor summary with major omissions or factual errors
- 0: Invalid summary - either completely inaccurate or missing critical information

## Example with Both Modes

```typescript
import { ToneConsistencyMetric } from "@mastra/evals/nlp";

const metric = new ToneConsistencyMetric();

// Tone Consistency Mode
const consistencyResult = await metric.measure(
  "This product is fantastic and amazing!",
  "The product is excellent and wonderful!"
);
// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.95,
//   info: {
//     responseSentiment: 0.8,
//     referenceSentiment: 0.75,
//     difference: 0.05
//   }
// }

// Tone Stability Mode
const stabilityResult = await metric.measure(
  "Great service! Friendly staff. Perfect atmosphere.",
  ""
);
// Example output:
// {
//   score: 0.9,
//   info: {
//     avgSentiment: 0.6,
//     sentimentVariance: 0.1
//   }
// }
```
