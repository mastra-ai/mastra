# Running Mastra Locally

Mastra sits inside your existing Next.js app. Its `init` command and admin console create or touch a number of files. Some it expects to own; others it simply modifies.

## Files Mastra owns

1. `mastra.config.ts`.

`mastra init` will create this file with the appropriate Postgres and Inngest connection strings. When you install a new integration through the admin console, it will modify this to add in the new integration information.

2. `mastra.docker-compose.yml`.

In order to run locally, Mastra needs a local Postgres database and a local Inngest server, both of which can be installed with Docker through the `init` command, which installs a `mastra.docker-compose.yml` file.

3. Routing file.

Mastra auto-generates a file for your app to use. The convention plays nicely with the [Next.js app router](https://nextjs.org/docs/app).

4. `/mastra/blueprints/`

The `mastra/blueprints` folder stores [workflow blueprints](./reference/workflows.mdx).

5. (optional) `/mastra/agents/`

The `mastra/agents` folder stores created [AI agent](./how-to/01-creating-agents.mdx) configuration.

6. (optional) `/mastra/vector-configs/`

The `mastra/vector-configs` folder stores Vector DB configuration that can be used in [RAG pipelines](./reference/rag-pipelines.md).

7. (optional) `/mastra/logs/`

If you configure file logging, the log files will be stored in this directory by default.

## Files Mastra modifies

The Mastra admin console modifies the following files:

1. `.env.development`.

When you install a new integration and enter in your app id and secrets, Mastra will store them in your `.env.development` file with the format `${APP_NAME}_CLIENT_ID` and `${APP_NAME}_CLIENT_SECRET`.

2. `tsconfig.json`.

Mastra adds some aliases to your `tsconfig.json` file to make it easier to import packages.

3. `package.json` and `package-lock.json`.

When you install additional integrations through the Mastra admin console, your package manager will install them from `npm`, which modifies these files.
