# Workflows API

The Workflows API provides methods to interact with and execute automated workflows in Mastra.

## Getting All Workflows

Retrieve a list of all available workflows:

```typescript
const workflows = await client.getWorkflows();
```

## Working with a Specific Workflow

Get an instance of a specific workflow:

```typescript
const workflow = client.getWorkflow("workflow-id");
```

## Workflow Methods

### Get Workflow Details

Retrieve detailed information about a workflow:

```typescript
const details = await workflow.details();
```

### Execute Workflow

Execute a workflow with input parameters and wait for full results on completion:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.execute({
  input: {
    param1: "value1",
    param2: "value2",
  },
});
```

### Resume Workflow

Resume a suspended workflow step:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.resume({
  stepId: "step-id",
  runId: "run-id",
  contextData: { key: "value" },
});
```

### Watch Workflow

Watch workflow transitions in real-time using an async iterator:

```typescript
try{
  // Get workflow instance
  const workflow = client.getWorkflow("workflow-id");

  // Start a new workflow run
  const {runId} = await workflow.startRun({
    input: {
      param1: "value1",
      param2: "value2",
    },
  });

  // Watch for workflow run
  const workflowWatch = workflow.watch({runId})

  // Watch for workflow transitions
  for await (const record of workflowWatch) {
    // Every new record is the latest transition state of the workflow run
    console.log({
      activePaths: record.activePaths,
      context: record.context,
      timestamp: record.timestamp,
      runId: record.runId
    });
  }

}catch(e){
  console.error(e);
}finally{
  console.log('Workflow done');
} 


```
The `watch()` method returns an AsyncGenerator that yields workflow transition records (`WorkflowRunResult`). Each record contains:

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `activePaths` | `Array<{ stepId: string; stepPath: string[]; status: 'completed' \| 'suspended' \| 'pending' }>` | Currently active paths in the workflow with their execution status |
| `context` | `{ steps: Record<string, { status: 'completed' \| 'suspended' \| 'running'; [key: string]: any }> }` | Current workflow context including step statuses and additional step data |
| `timestamp` | `number` | Unix timestamp of when this transition occurred |
| `runId` | `string` | Unique identifier for this workflow run instance |
| `suspendedSteps` | `Record<string, any>` | Map of currently suspended steps and their suspension data |

This makes it easy to process workflow transitions in real-time using a simple for-await loop. The generator will automatically close when all steps in the workflow have reached a terminal state (`completed`, `suspended`, or `failed`).
