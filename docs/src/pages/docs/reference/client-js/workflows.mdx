# Workflows API

The Workflows API provides methods to interact with and execute automated workflows in Mastra.

## Getting All Workflows

Retrieve a list of all available workflows:

```typescript
const workflows = await client.getWorkflows();
```

## Working with a Specific Workflow

Get an instance of a specific workflow:

```typescript
const workflow = client.getWorkflow("workflow-id");
```

## Workflow Methods

### Get Workflow Details

Retrieve detailed information about a workflow:

```typescript
const details = await workflow.details();
```

### Execute Workflow

Execute a workflow with input parameters:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.execute({
  input: {
    param1: "value1",
    param2: "value2",
  },
});
```

### Resume Workflow

Resume a suspended workflow step:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.resume({
  stepId: "step-id",
  runId: "run-id",
  contextData: { key: "value" },
});
```

### Watch Workflow

Watch workflow transitions in real-time using an async iterator:

```typescript
// Get workflow instance
const workflow = client.getWorkflow("workflow-id");

const workflowWatch = workflow.watch()

// Execute workflow
workflow.execute()

// Watch for workflow transitions
for await (const record of workflowWatch) {
  // Each record contains workflow transition data
  console.log({
    activePaths: record.activePaths,
    context: record.context,
    timestamp: record.timestamp
    runId: record.runId
  });
}


```

The `watch()` method returns an AsyncGenerator that yields workflow transition records. Each record contains:
- `activePaths`: Currently active paths in the workflow
- `context`: Current workflow context data
- `timestamp`: Timestamp of the transition
- `runId`: Uniqe Identifier for workflow run

This makes it easy to process workflow transitions in real-time using a simple for-await loop.
