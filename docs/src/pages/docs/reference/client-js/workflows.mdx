# Workflows API

The Workflows API provides methods to interact with and execute automated workflows in Mastra.

## Getting All Workflows

Retrieve a list of all available workflows:

```typescript
const workflows = await client.getWorkflows();
```

## Working with a Specific Workflow

Get an instance of a specific workflow:

```typescript
const workflow = client.getWorkflow("workflow-id");
```

## Workflow Methods

### Get Workflow Details

Retrieve detailed information about a workflow:

```typescript
const details = await workflow.details();
```

### Execute Workflow

Execute a workflow with input parameters:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.execute({
  input: {
    param1: "value1",
    param2: "value2",
  },
});
```

### Resume Workflow

Resume a suspended workflow step:

```typescript
const result = await workflow.resume({
  stepId: "step-id",
  runId: "run-id",
  contextData: { key: "value" },
});
```

### Watch Workflow

Watch workflow transitions in real-time:

```typescript
const response = await workflow.watch();

// Read Transition Data from response body
const reader = response.body.getReader();
let buffer = "";
while (true) {
  const { done, value } = await reader.read();
  if (done) break;
  buffer += new TextDecoder().decode(value);

  // Split the buffer into records
  const records = buffer.split("\x1E");

  buffer = records.pop() || "";

  // Process each record
  for (const record of records) {
    // Handle each record
    const { activePaths, context, timestamp } = record;
    console.log({
      activePaths,
      context,
      timestamp,
    });
  }
}
```
