# NetlifyDeployer

The NetlifyDeployer deploys Mastra applications to Netlify Functions, handling site creation, configuration, and deployment processes. It extends the abstract Deployer class to provide Netlify-specific deployment functionality.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { NetlifyDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-netlify';

const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new NetlifyDeployer({
    scope: 'your-team-slug',
    projectName: 'your-project-name',
    token: 'your-netlify-token'
  }),
  // ... other Mastra configuration options
});
```

## Parameters

### Constructor Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "scope",
      type: "string",
      description: "Your Netlify team slug or ID.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "projectName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of your Netlify site (will be created if it doesn't exist).",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "token",
      type: "string",
      description: "Your Netlify authentication token.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Netlify Configuration

The NetlifyDeployer automatically generates a `netlify.toml` configuration file with the following settings:

```toml
[functions]
node_bundler = "esbuild"            
directory = "netlify/functions"

[[redirects]]
force = true
from = "/*"
status = 200
to = "/.netlify/functions/api/:splat"
```

### Environment Variables

The NetlifyDeployer handles environment variables from multiple sources:

1. **Environment Files**: Variables from `.env.production` and `.env` files.
2. **Configuration**: Variables passed through the Mastra configuration.
3. **Netlify Dashboard**: Variables can also be managed through Netlify's web interface.

### Project Structure

The deployer creates the following structure in your output directory:

```
output-directory/
├── netlify/
│   └── functions/
│       └── api/
│           └── index.mjs    # Application entry point with Hono server integration
└── netlify.toml             # Deployment configuration
```
