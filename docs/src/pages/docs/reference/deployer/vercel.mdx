# VercelDeployer

The VercelDeployer deploys Mastra applications to Vercel, handling configuration, environment variable synchronization, and deployment processes. It extends the abstract Deployer class to provide Vercel-specific deployment functionality.

## Usage Example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { VercelDeployer } from '@mastra/deployer-vercel';

const mastra = new Mastra({
  deployer: new VercelDeployer({
    teamId: 'your-team-id',
    projectName: 'your-project-name',
    token: 'your-vercel-token'
  }),
  // ... other Mastra configuration options
});
```

## Parameters

### Constructor Parameters

<PropertiesTable
  content={[
    {
      name: "teamId",
      type: "string",
      description: "Your Vercel team ID.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "projectName",
      type: "string",
      description: "Name of your Vercel project (will be created if it doesn't exist).",
      isOptional: false,
    },
    {
      name: "token",
      type: "string",
      description: "Your Vercel authentication token.",
      isOptional: false,
    },
  ]}
/>

### Vercel Configuration

The VercelDeployer automatically generates a `vercel.json` configuration file with the following settings:

```json
{
  "version": 2,
  "installCommand": "npm install --omit=dev",
  "builds": [
    {
      "src": "index.mjs",
      "use": "@vercel/node",
      "config": {
        "includeFiles": ["**"]
      }
    }
  ],
  "routes": [
    {
      "src": "/(.*)",
      "dest": "index.mjs"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Environment Variables

The VercelDeployer handles environment variables from multiple sources:

1. **Environment Files**: Variables from `.env.production` and `.env` files.
2. **Configuration**: Variables passed through the Mastra configuration.
3. **Vercel Dashboard**: Variables can also be managed through Vercel's web interface.

The deployer automatically synchronizes environment variables between your local development environment and Vercel's environment variable system, ensuring consistency across all deployment environments (production, preview, and development).

### Project Structure

The deployer creates the following structure in your output directory:

```
output-directory/
├── vercel.json     # Deployment configuration
└── index.mjs       # Application entry point with Hono server integration
```
