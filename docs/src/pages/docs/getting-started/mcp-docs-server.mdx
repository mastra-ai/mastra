# Mastra Tools for your agentic IDE

`@mastra/mcp-docs-server` provides direct access to Mastra's complete knowledge base in Cursor, Windsurf, Cline, or any other IDE that supports MCP.
It has documentation, code examples, technical blog posts / feature announcements, and package changelogs which your IDE can read to help you build with Mastra.

## How it works

The MCP server tools have been designed to allow an agent to query the specific information it needs to complete a Mastra related task - for example: adding a Mastra feature to an agent, scaffolding a new project, or helping you understand how something works.

Once it's installed you can send the agent prompts and assume in understands Mastra.

Add features:

- "Add evals to my agent and write tests"
- "Write me a workflow that does the following [...]"
- "Make a new tool that allows my agent to [...]"

Ask about integrations:

- "Does Mastra work with the AI SDK? How can I use it in my [React/Svelte/etc] project?"
- "What's the latest Mastra news around MCP?"
- "Does Mastra support [provider]'s speech and voice API? Show me an example in my code of how I can use it."

Debug or updating existing code:

- "I'm running into a bug with agent memory, have there been any related changes or bug fixes recently?"
- "How does working memory behave in Mastra and how can I use it to do [task]?"
- "I saw there are new workflow features, explain them to me and then update [workflow] to use them."

And more - if you have a question, try asking your IDE and let it look it up for you.

## Automatic Installation

Run `pnpm create mastra@latest` and select Cursor or Windsurf when prompted to install the MCP server. For other IDEs, or if you already have a Mastra project, install the MCP server by following the instructions below.

## Installation

- **Cursor**: Edit `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root, or `~/.cursor/mcp.json` for global configuration
- **Windsurf**: Edit `~/.codeium/windsurf/mcp_config.json` (only supports global configuration)

Add the following configuration:

MacOS/Linux:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastra": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

Windows:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mastra": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "@mastra/mcp-docs-server@latest"]
    }
  }
}
```

After adding the configuration:

In Cursor:

1. Open Cursor settings
2. Navigate to MCP settings
3. Click "enable" on the Mastra MCP server
4. If you have an agent chat open, you'll need to re-open it or start a new chat to use the MCP server

In Windsurf:

1. Fully quit and re-open Windsurf
2. If tool calls start failing, go to Windsurfs MCP settings and re-start the MCP server. This is a common Windsurf MCP issue and isn't related to Mastra. Right now Cursor's MCP server is more stable than Windsurfs is.

In both IDEs it may take a minute for the MCP server to start the first time as it needs to download the package from npm.
