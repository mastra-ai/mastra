# Getting Started with Memory

Mastra makes it simple to add memory capabilities to your agents, allowing them to recall past interactions and maintain context. This guide will help you set up and use memory in your application.

## Quick Start: Try Memory in 5 Minutes

The fastest way to experiment with Mastra's memory system is using the built-in development playground.

**1. Setup Your Project:**

If you haven't already, create a Mastra project by following the main [Getting Started guide](/docs/getting-started/installation).

Once your project is set up, install the memory package in your project directory:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/memory
```

By default, Mastra memory uses LibSQL for storage and FastEmbed for embeddings, which are included in the package.

**2. Add Memory to Your Agent:**

In your project's `src/mastra/agents/index.ts` file, create an agent and attach a `Memory` instance:

```typescript filename="src/mastra/agents/index.ts"
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core/agent";
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { openai } from "@ai-sdk/openai"; // Or your preferred LLM provider

export const myMemoryAgent = new Agent({
  name: "MemoryAgent",
  instructions: "You are a helpful assistant with memory capabilities. Remember things I tell you.",
  model: openai("gpt-4o"), // Ensure you have OPENAI_API_KEY in your .env
  memory: new Memory(), // Basic memory setup
});
```

**3. Start the Development Server:**

Run the Mastra development server:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm run dev
```

**4. Use the Playground:**

Open the playground in your browser (usually `http://localhost:4111`). Select your `MemoryAgent`.

The playground interface shows a list of memory threads (conversations) in the left sidebar and the main chat area where you interact with the selected agent.

Now, interact with your agent in the main chat area. Try giving it some information and referencing it later:

```
➡️ You: My favorite color is blue.
⬅️ Agent: Got it! I'll remember that your favorite color is blue.
➡️ You: What is my favorite color?
⬅️ Agent: Your favorite color is blue.
```

The playground automatically manages `resourceId` and `threadId` for each conversation thread in the sidebar, making it easy to see memory in action.

## Using Memory in Your Application

When integrating memory into your actual application (e.g., a web app, API), you **must** provide `resourceId` and `threadId` with each agent call. This ensures conversations are correctly associated with users and specific chat sessions.

- `resourceId`: Typically identifies the user (e.g., `user_123`, `customer_abc`).
- `threadId`: Identifies a specific conversation (e.g., a UUID like `conv_f4a7...`).

```typescript
// Example of calling the agent from your application code

// First interaction in a specific conversation for a user
await myMemoryAgent.stream("Hello, my name is Alice.", {
  resourceId: "user_alice",       // Identifies the user
  threadId: "conversation_123", // Identifies this specific conversation
});

// Later interaction within the same conversation
// Memory is automatically retrieved using the same IDs
await myMemoryAgent.stream("What's my name again?", {
  resourceId: "user_alice",
  threadId: "conversation_123",
}); // Agent will respond: "Your name is Alice."
```

Providing these IDs allows the agent to:

- Store messages correctly for each user and conversation.
- Retrieve the relevant context for future interactions.
- Maintain conversation continuity.
