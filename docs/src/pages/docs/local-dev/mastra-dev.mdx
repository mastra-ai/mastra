# Inspecting agents and workflows with `mastra Dev`

The `mastra dev` command launches a development server that serves your Mastra application locally.

## REST API Endpoints

`mastra dev` spins up REST API endpoints for your agents and workflows, such as:

- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/generate`
- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/stream`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/start`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/event`
- `GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/status`

By default, the server runs at http://localhost:4111, but you can change the port with the `--port` flag.

## Using the Client SDK

The easiest way to interact with your local Mastra server is through our [TypeScript/JavaScript Client SDK](/docs/reference/client-js). Install it with:

```bash
npm install @mastra/client-js
```

Then configure it to point to your local server:

```typescript
import { MastraClient } from "@mastra/client-js";

const client = new MastraClient({
  baseUrl: "http://localhost:4111",
});

// Example: Interact with a local agent
const agent = client.getAgent("my-agent");
const response = await agent.generate({
  messages: [{ role: "user", content: "Hello!" }],
});
```

The client SDK provides type-safe wrappers for all API endpoints, making it much easier to develop and test your Mastra applications locally.

## UI Playground

`mastra dev` creates a UI with an agent chat interface, a workflow visualizer and a tool playground.
