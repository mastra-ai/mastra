# Local Development Environment

Mastra provides a local development environment where you can test your agents, workflows and tools while 
developing locally.

## Launch development server

You can launch the mastra development environment using the mastra CLI by running:

```bash  copy
mastra dev
```
By default, the server runs at http://localhost:4111, but you can change the port with the `--port` flag.


## Dev Playground

`mastra dev` serves a UI with an agent chat interface, a workflow visualizer and a tool playground.

## REST API Endpoints
`mastra dev` also spins up REST API endpoints for your agents and workflows via the local [Mastra Server](/docs/deployment/server). This allows you to test your
endpoints before deployment. 

- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/generate`
- `POST /api/agents/:agentId/stream`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/start`
- `POST /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/event`
- `GET /api/workflows/:workflowId/:instanceId/status`

mastra also provides a [Mastra Client](/docs/deployment/client) SDK that allows you interact with your served REST API endpoints seamlessly.



## OpenAPI Specification

`mastra dev` provides an OpenAPI spec at http://localhost:4111/openapi.json

## Summary

`mastra dev` makes it easy to develop, debug, and iterate on your AI logic in a self-contained environment before deploying to production.
