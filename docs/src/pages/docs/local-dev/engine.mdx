# Using the Mastra Engine

The Mastra Engine provides PostgreSQL-based storage for two core AI application needs:

1. Agent Memory - Persistent storage for conversation history and agent state
2. Vector Operations - Storage and similarity search for RAG applications

Mastra Engine is not required to run Mastra, but provides a "batteries-included" local development experience and a production-ready data layer.

## Setting up for local development

The Mastra CLI includes commands to manage your engine and database:

- `mastra engine add`: Sets up your dev environment, starts Docker containers for Postgres, and configures `.env`.
- `mastra engine up`: Starts your Docker containers as defined in your docker config file.
- `mastra engine migrate`: Runs database migrations.
- `mastra engine generate`: Generates TypeScript types from your database schema.
- `mastra engine down`: Stops your Docker containers.

The engine will run by default on port 5432 of `localhost`.

## Configuring for Agent Memory

Configure your agent to use PostgreSQL for memory storage:

```typescript
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PgMemory } from "@mastra/memory";

const pgMemory = new PgMemory({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: pgMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Now, agent memory operations like `saveMemory`, `getContextWindow`, and `getMemory` are available to your agent. See the [Memory](/docs/agents/01-agent-memory) reference for more details.

## Vector Operations (RAG)

For RAG applications, you can set up vector storage and reranking:

```typescript
import { PgVector } from "@mastra/rag";
import { Reranker } from "@mastra/rerank";

// Initialize vector store and reranker
const vectorStore = new PgVector({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING!,
});
```

## Deploying to Production

To deploy to production, you'll need to set up a production Postgres database and configure your Mastra application to use it.

You can run `DB_URL=your_prod_db_url mastra engine migrate` to create a schema in a production database.

## Mocking for Tests

For testing or development, you can use the `MockMastraEngine`:

```typescript
import { MockMastraEngine } from "@mastra/core";

const mockEngine = new MockMastraEngine({ url: "mock://localhost" });

// Create an entity
const entity = await mockEngine.createEntity({
  name: "Contacts",
  connectionId: "user_123",
});

// Insert records
await mockEngine.upsertRecords({
  entityId: entity.id,
  records: [
    { externalId: "c1", data: { name: "Alice" }, entityType: "Contacts" },
    { externalId: "c2", data: { name: "Bob" }, entityType: "Contacts" },
  ],
});

// Query the records
const records = await mockEngine.getRecordsByEntityId({ entityId: entity.id });
console.log(records);
```

This mock engine mimics the behavior of the real engine without requiring a real database connection, making it ideal for unit tests.

## Summary

The Mastra Engine is a PostgreSQL instance that stores agent memory and vector embeddings. You can spin it up locally with Docker for development and deploy it to a production instance. It's a helpful starting spot for handling agent memory and vector operations -- start with Postgres + pgvector, then adapt individual components based on your needs.
