# Adding an integration

Before you can use an integration, you need to add it to Mastra. If it's an OAuth-based connection, you will also need to authenticate a user in order to create a connection.

## Adding integrations

Mastra's default integrations are packaged as individually installable modules, which you can add to your project.

You can browse (and install) the integrations within your admin console, or see them [on npm](https://www.npmjs.com/org/mastra) or in the docs.

Before you add an integration, you need to have the relevant credentials to connect to the third-party service. This means getting an API key or a client ID and secret from the provider.

The default way to do this is to install an integration from the Mastra admin console, but you can also manually modify the files.

## Through the admin console

## Manually

You can install an integration by installing the package from npm and then importing it into your `mastra-config.ts` file.

For example, for Google Calendar, you'd run:

`npm install @mastra/google-calendar`

Then, import it into your `mastra-config.ts` file:

```ts
import { GoogleCalendarIntegration } from '@mastra/google-calendar';

// rest of config

export const config: Config = {
  ...restOfConfig,
  integrations: [
    new GoogleCalendarIntegration({
      config: {
        CLIENT_ID: process.env.GCAL_CLIENT_ID!,
        CLIENT_SECRET: process.env.GCAL_CLIENT_SECRET!,
        SCOPES: undefined,
      },
    }),
    ...restOfIntegrations,
  ],
};
```

## Creating a connection and querying the client

To get a connection from an integration, you need to call `getApiClient` on the integration, passing in a connection ID.

You can then use the client to query the third-party API.

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

import { config } from '../../mastra.config';

const doStuff = async () => {
  const framework = Mastra.init(config);
  const client = await framework.getIntegration('GITHUB').getApiClient({ connectionId: 'system' });

  const openPRs = await client[`/repos/${githubOrg}/${githubRepo}/pulls`].get();
};
```

## Browsing available events

Integrations come installed with events that you can trigger. These events are specified in the format:

`<integration>.<entity>/<event-type>`

For example, `asana.TasksForProject/sync` or `google.emailSync/sync`.

The admin console includes an integration playground, which allows you to browse events from the integrations you've installed, as well as trigger them and see your application's response.

## Creating a custom integration

If you need an integration that hasn't been created yet, Mastra lets you write custom integrations in an `integrations` folder.

See [custom integrations](../reference/custom-integrations.md) for more information.

If you are looking for an integration we do not have yet, [contact us](https://mastra.ai/contact) as we may be able to build it for you.
