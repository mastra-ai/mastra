# Introduction

Mastra is an opinionated Typescript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, integrations, syncs and evals. You can run Mastra on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main Mastra features are:

| Features                                                       | Description                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [LLM Models](../guide/llm-models/00-overview.mdx)                | Mastra supports a variety of LLM providers, including OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini.                                                                         |
| [Agents](../guide/agents/00-overview.mdx)                   | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions.                                                                                      |
| [Tools](../guide/agents/02-adding-tools.mdx)                       | Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation.                               |
| [Workflows](../guide/workflows/00-overview.mdx)             | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines with built-in tracing. They can execute complex sequences of LLM operations.                                   |
| [RAG](../guide/rag/overview.mdx)                    | Retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for your agents.                                                                      |
| [Integrations & Syncs](../guide/engine/integrations.mdx) | In Mastra, syncs are async functions that can be deployed as background tasks. Integrations are auto-generated, type-safe API clients for third-party services. |
| [Evals](../guide/08-running-evals)                      | Evals are automated tests that evaluate LLM outputs using model-graded, rule-based, and statistical methods.                                                    |
