# Mastra Framework

Mastra is an opinionated Typescript framework that helps you build AI applications and features quickly. It gives you the set of primitives you need: workflows, agents, RAG, and more. You can run it on your local machine, or deploy to a serverless cloud.

The main Mastra features are:

--------|--------
Features|Description
--------|--------
Agents | Agents are systems where the language model chooses a sequence of actions. They provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data. Agents can call your own functions or APIs of third-party integrations; they can access knowledge bases you build.
Workflows | Workflows are durable graph-based state machines. They have loops, branching, wait for human input, embed other workflows, do error handling, retries, parsing and so on. They can be built in code or with a visual editor. Each step in a workflow has built-in OpenTelemetry tracing. 
RAG | Retrieval-augemented generation (RAG) lets you construct a knowledge base for agents. RAG is an ETL pipeline with specific querying techniques. You “chunk” documents into smaller pieces, “embed” each chunk (transform it to a vector), and load it into a vector DB. Then, you embed your query text into a vector, search the DB for similar vectors, and feed the results into an LLM call.
Integrations & Syncs | Mastra provides helpers for you to load your data into a RAG pipeline: scraping from websites, loading from files, or syncing from third-party SaaS services. It also provides third-party APIs you can give to an agent to take action. 
Evals | Evals are how you test agents and workflows. You can test intermediate steps of a workflow, or user-facing LLM results. You can check accuracy, relevance, factual consistency, length adherence, and more. You might write evals checking semantic distance, search for a particular string, or have another LLM evaluate your LLM's response.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or later)
- Docker (the daemon should be running)

### Installing Next.js

Start by creating a new Next.js App Router project in TypeScript. You can initialize one quickly with

```bash copy
npx create-next-app --ts --eslint --src-dir --tailwind --import-alias "@/*" --app
```

Once installed, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

### Install global CLI

```bash copy
npm install -g mastra
```

### Add the core package

From the root of your Next.js project:

```bash copy
npm install @mastra/core
```

### Initialize your project:

```bash copy
mastra init
```

Provision local resources:

```bash copy filename="terminal"
$ Enter your PostgreSQL connection string (postgresql://username:password@host:port/database) or press Enter to create a new instance:
$ Enter your Inngest server URL or press Enter to create a new instance:
```

### Run the Mastra dev server:

```bash copy
mastra dev
```

</Steps>

## Configuration

After initialization, you'll find an `mastra.config.ts` file in your project root. You can find the full list of configuration options in the [Mastra config docs](./reference/mastra-config.mdx) and a reference of the files Mastra owns in the [Local File Structure docs](./reference/local-project-structure.mdx).

## Deployment

Mastra's data syncing infrastructure is designed for Next.js sites running on serverless hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify.

Job queues are managed with [Inngest](https://inngest.com/), which can be self-hosted or run as a managed service.

Logs can be configured to be written to the console, written to the filesystem, or stored in [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).
