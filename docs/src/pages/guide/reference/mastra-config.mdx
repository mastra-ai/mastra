# mastra-config.mdx

Mastra's configuration file is a `ts` file that exports a `Config` object. Here's the structure:

## Project Configuration

### Key Fields

#### Name

- `name`: string - The name of your Mastra project.

### Other fields

- `systemHostURL` (optional): string - Mastra uses this when it's creating OAuth connection strings. Defaults to `process.env.APP_URL`.
- `routeRegistrationPath` (optional): string - Mastra puts a templated `route.js` folder in your app at this path that works with Next.js to handle. Defaults to `/api/mastra`.

## Database Configuration

Mastra needs a database to store the state of the system: authentication credentials and synced records. Mastra supports any database that Prisma does.

- `db`: object - Database configuration.
  - `provider`: 'postgres' - The database provider.
  - `uri`: string - The connection URI for your database.

When you deploy, we recommend setting `uri` to an environment variable so that you can have different values for production and development.

## Runner Configuration

Mastra uses Inngest to run background jobs, like refreshing credentials and syncing records.

- `runner`: object - The runner configuration.
  - `provider`: 'inngest' - The runner provider.
  - `uri`: string - The connection URI for your runner.

When you deploy, we recommend setting `uri` to an environment variable so that you can have different values for production and development.

## Agents Configuration

```typescript
interface AgentsConfig {
  agentDirPath: string;      // Path to agent configuration directory
  vectorProvider: VectorProvider[];  // Vector store configurations
}

interface VectorProvider {
  name: 'PINECONE';          // Vector store provider name
  apiKey: string;            // Provider API key
  dirPath?: string;          // Optional: Custom directory path for provider configs
}
```

### Required Fields
- `agentDirPath`: Directory where agent configurations are stored
- `vectorProvider`: Array of vector store providers
  - `name`: Provider name (currently supports 'PINECONE')
  - `apiKey`: Authentication key for the provider

### Optional Fields
- `vectorProvider[].dirPath`: Custom path for provider-specific configurations

### Example
```typescript
export const config: Config = {
  agents: {
    agentDirPath: '/mastra-agents',
    vectorProvider: [
      {
        name: 'PINECONE',
        apiKey: process.env.PINECONE_API_KEY!,
        dirPath: '/custom/vector/path'
      },
    ],
  },
}
```

### Environment Variables
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`: Your Pinecone API key
- `MASTRA_APP_DIR`: Optional: Override for application directory

For detailed vector store configuration, see the Vector Store Configuration documentation.

## Workflow Configuration

Workflows consume events and trigger actions. Your system will define the events that can trigger workflows, and you can also consume events from external systems.

- `workflows`: object - Workflow configuration.
  - `systemEvents`: `Record<string, SystemEvent>` - An object defining events that happen in your app that you want to trigger workflows from.
  - `blueprintDirPath`: string - The directory path for storing blueprints (defaults to `/mastra/blueprints`).
  - `systemApis`: SystemApis[] - An array of system-level apis.

## Integration Configuration

- `integrations`: Integration[] - An array of integration instances to be used in your project.

Integrations have to be individually installed, authenticated, and imported in the `mastra.config.ts` file. If you use the `admin` app, it will help you with the process.

The integration config object will vary depending on the authentication type of the integration:

- OAuth-based integrations will have `CLIENT_ID`, `CLIENT_SECRET`, and `SCOPES` as required fields.
- API key-based integrations will have `API_KEY` as a required field.
- Basic auth-based integrations will have `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` as required fields.

Integrations can also define additional required or optional fields. Look at the package README for additional details.
