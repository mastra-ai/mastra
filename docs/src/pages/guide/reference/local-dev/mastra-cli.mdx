# The Mastra CLI

The Mastra CLI enables you to get up and running with mastra quickly. It is not required to use mastra, but helpful for getting started and scaffolding your project structure.

## Installing the Mastra CLI

```bash copy
npm i -g mastra
```

The Mastra CLI has the following commands:

### Setup

#### `mastra init`

This creates a new Mastra project. You can run it in three different ways:

1. **Interactive Mode (Recommended)**
   Run without flags to use the interactive prompt, which will guide you through:

   - Choosing a directory for Mastra files
   - Selecting components to install (Agents, Tools, Workflows)
   - Choosing a default LLM provider (OpenAI, Anthropic, or Groq)
   - Deciding whether to include example code

2. **Quick Start with Defaults**

   ```bash
   mastra init --default
   ```

   This sets up a project with:

   - Source directory: `src/`
   - All components: agents, tools, workflows
   - OpenAI as the default provider
   - No example code

3. **Custom Setup**
   ```bash
   mastra init --dir src/mastra --components agents,tools --llm openai --example
   ```
   Options:
   - `-d, --dir`: Directory for Mastra files (defaults to src/mastra)
   - `-c, --components`: Comma-separated list of components (agents, tools, workflows)
   - `-l, --llm`: Default model provider (openai, anthropic, or groq)
   - `-e, --example`: Include example code
   - `-ne, --no-example`: Skip example code

### Agents

#### `mastra agent new`

Creates a new agent and automatically updates the agent index file. This command will:

- Guide you through creating a new agent
- Generate the necessary boilerplate code
- Update the agent index to include the new agent

#### `mastra agent list`

Lists all available agents in your project with a numbered index for easy reference.

### Engine

#### `mastra engine add`

Installs the `@mastra/engine` dependency to your project. The Mastra engine enables:

- **Data Persistence**: Store conversation history, agent states, and vector embeddings
- **Background Processing**: Run long-running tasks and data synchronization jobs
- **RAG Capabilities**: Build and search knowledge bases with vector embeddings
- **Type Safety**: Generate TypeScript types from your database schema

While not required for basic agent interactions, the engine becomes essential when your application needs persistence, background tasks, or vector search capabilities.

#### `mastra engine generate`

Generates the Drizzle database client and TypeScript types based on your database schema. Requires a valid database connection.

#### `mastra engine up`

Sets up your development environment by:

1. Running `docker-compose up` to start required Docker containers
2. Creating or updating your environment file with the correct database URL
3. Configuring the necessary environment variables

#### `mastra engine migrate`

Runs database migrations to keep your schema up to date.

- Requires a valid `DB_URL` in your environment file
- If `DB_URL` is missing, you'll be prompted to run `mastra engine up` first
- Automatically applies any pending migrations

### Server

#### `mastra dev`

Starts a development server that creates REST API endpoints for your agents and workflows:

**Endpoints Created:**

- `/agent/:agentId/text` - Text completion with any agent
- `/agent/:agentId/stream` - Streaming responses from any agent
- `/workflows/:workflowId/execute` - Execute any workflow

Example usage:

```bash
# Start the server
mastra serve

# Make a request to an agent
curl -X POST http://localhost:4111/agent/my-agent/text \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"messages": ["Your prompt here"]}'
```

The server:

- Runs on port 4111 by default
- Loads environment from `.env.development` or `.env`
- Automatically configures available API keys

For more help on any command, you can run:

```bash
mastra [command] --help
```
