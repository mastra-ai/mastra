# The Mastra CLI

The Mastra CLI enables you to get up and running with mastra quickly. It is not required to use mastra, but helpful for getting started and more advanced use cases.

## Installing the Mastra CLI

```bash copy
npm i -g mastra@alpha
```

The Mastra CLI has the following commands:

### Setup

`mastra init`

This creates a mastra directory under `src` containing an `index.ts` entrypoint and an `agent` directory containing two sample agents.

```text
project-root/
├── src/
   ├── app/
   └── mastra/
       ├── agents/
       │   └── agents.ts
       └── index.ts
```

#### Agents

`mastra agent new`

This creates a new agent.

`mastra agent list`

This lists all available agents.

#### Engine commands

`mastra engine add`

This installs the `@mastra/engine` dependency to your project.

`mastra engine generate`

Generates the Drizzle database client and TypeScript types.

`mastra engine migrate`

This migrates the database forward. You might need to run this after updating mastra.

`mastra engine up`

This is a shortcut that runs the `docker-compose up` command using the `mastra-pg.docker-compose.yaml` file. This will spin up any local docker containers that mastra needs.

It is useful for cases where you don't have a dockerized `postgres` db setup.
