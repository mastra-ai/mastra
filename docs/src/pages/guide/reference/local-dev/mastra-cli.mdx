# The Mastra CLI

The Mastra CLI enables you to get up and running with mastra . With just one commands, you can set up and start a new local project:

`mastra init`: initializes agents and adds to your `mastra` instance.

## Installing the Mastra CLI

```bash copy
npm i -g mastra@alpha
```

The Mastra CLI has the following commands:

### Setup

`mastra init`

This creates a mastra directory under `src` containing an `index.ts` entrypoint and an `agent` directory containing two sample agents.

```text
project-root/
├── src/
   ├── app/
   └── mastra/
       ├── agents/
       │   └── agents.ts
       └── index.ts
```

#### Agents

`mastra agent new`

This creates a new agent.

`mastra agent list`

This lists all available agents

#### Engine commands

`mastra engine add`

This installs the `@mastra/engine` dependency to your project.

`mastra engine generate`

This generates (or regenerates) the Typescript types and Drizzle client. You might need to run this after updating mastra.

`mastra engine migrate`

This migrates the database forward. You might need to run this after updating mastra.

`mastra engine up`

This is a shortcut that runs the docker-compose up command using the mastra-pg.docker-compose.yaml file. This will spin up any local docker containers that mastra needs.
It is useful for cases where you don't have a dockerized `postgres` db setup.
