# Agent Memory

Agents in Mastra have a memory that stores conversation history and contextual information. This memory allows agents to maintain state across interactions, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.

There are three main ways to implement agent memory in Mastra:

1. **In-Memory Storage** (Default)
2. **Using Mastra Engine**
3. **Using External Storage (Redis or PostgreSQL)**

## 1. Default In-Memory Storage

Let's start by revisiting the example from the [overview](/guide/creating-agents/00-overview.mdx) page.

```typescript showLineNumbers filename="src/mastra/index.ts" copy
const response1 = await myAgent.generate("Which LLM model are you?", {
  threadId: "thread_1",
});

await myAgent.memory.save("thread_1");
const memoryMessages = await myAgent.memory.getMessages({
  threadId: "thread_1",
});
console.log("Agent Memory:", memoryMessages);
```

This is the simplest way to use agent memory -- with the default in-memory storage. It's suitable for local development, testing, or backend processes outside the context of a user session and request/response cycle.

Especially if you're using `mastra dev` or otherwise running agents behind an API, you'll want to use a more persistent memory backend.

## 2. Using Mastra Engine

The Mastra engine is a Postgres database that you can install locally using the Mastra CLI. It's a helpful backend for agent memory during development because you can inspect agent memory more easily.

### Setting Up Mastra Engine for Agent Memory

1. **Install Mastra Engine**:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/engine
```

2. **Configure Mastra**:

```typescript showLineNumbers
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { mastraEngine } from "@mastra/engine";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  engine: mastraEngine,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

3. **Run Mastra Engine**:

```bash
mastra engine up
```

This command sets up the necessary infrastructure for Mastra Engine.

## 3. Using External Storage

For production environments where you need persistent memory across restarts and scalability, you can use external storage backends like Redis or PostgreSQL.

### Using Redis for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory redis
```

Then, configure your agent to use Redis for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RedisMemory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { createClient } from "redis";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a Redis client
const redisClient = createClient({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL, // e.g., "redis://localhost:6379"
});

redisClient.connect();

const redisMemory = new RedisMemory({
  client: redisClient,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: redisMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Ensure you have your Redis URL set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
REDIS_URL=redis://your_redis_server_url
```

### Using PostgreSQL for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory pg
```

Then, configure your agent to use PostgreSQL for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PostgresMemory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { Pool } from "pg";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a PostgreSQL pool
const pgPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,
});

const pgMemory = new PostgresMemory({
  pool: pgPool,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: pgMemory,
  agents: { myAgent },
});
```

Ensure you have your PostgreSQL connection string set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database
```

## Managing Agent Memory

Once your agent is configured with a memory backend, you can manage its memory using the following methods.

### Saving the Agent's Memory

Save the agent's memory state with a unique identifier:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.save("memory_id");
```

This persists the current memory state, allowing you to reload it later.

### Loading the Agent's Memory

Load a previously saved memory state:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.load("memory_id");
```

This replaces the agent's current memory with the saved state associated with `memory_id`.

### Clearing the Agent's Memory

To clear the agent's memory, removing all stored messages and context:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.clear();
```

This resets the agent's memory to an empty state.
