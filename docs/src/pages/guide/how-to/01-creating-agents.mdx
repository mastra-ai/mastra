# Creating Agents

Agents can interact with your data and perform tasks. When using Mastra, an agent is a collection of tools, knowledge sources, and workflows that work together to achieve a specific goal.

## Configuring an agent

Mastra agents are configured in your [`mastra.config.ts`](../reference/local-dev/mastra-config.mdx) file or through the Mastra Admin UI.

```ts filename="mastra.config.ts"
export const config: Config = {
  ...mastraConfig,
  agents: {
    agentDirPath: '/mastra/agents',
  },
};
```

```json filename="gmail-manager.json"
{
  "id": "asst_gmail_manager",
  "name": "gmail-manager",
  "agentInstructions": "You can get information about a gmail account, send gmail messages and report your findings to slack",
  "model": {
    "provider": "OPEN_AI_ASSISTANT",
    "name": "gpt-4o-mini",
    "toolChoice": "auto"
  },
  "outputs": {
    "text": true,
    "structured": {}
  },
  "tools": {
    "gmailUsersMessagesGet": true,
    "gmailUsersMessagesList": true,
    "chatPostMessage": true
  }
}
```

### Choosing a Provider

Mastra recommends using the OpenAI Assistants API for agents. In addition to the OpenAI Assistants API, you can also use all OpenAI, Anthropic, and Gemini models through the AI SDK library.

### Adding Instructions

Good agent instructions should be specific, contextual, and include clear constraints. Break down complex tasks into discrete steps, and explicitly state what the agent can and cannot do.

### Adding tools

Agents can be equipped with different types of tools:

- functions you write
- APIs from integrations you install
- [knowledge sources](./03-knowledge-sources.mdx) you create
- [workflows](./02-building-workflows.mdx) you create
