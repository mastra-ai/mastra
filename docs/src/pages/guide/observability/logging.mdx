## Logging

In Mastra, logs can detail when certain functions run, what input data they receive, and how they respond.

### Basic Setup

Here’s a minimal example that sets up a **console logger** at the `INFO` level. This will print out informational messages and above (i.e., `INFO`, `WARN`, `ERROR`) to the console.

```typescript filename="mastra.config.ts" showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra, createLogger } from "@mastra/core";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  // Other Mastra configuration...
  logger: createLogger({
    type: "CONSOLE",
    level: "INFO",
  }),
});
```

In this configuration:

- `type: "CONSOLE"` specifies that logs should be output to the console.
- `level: "INFO"` sets the minimum severity of logs to record.

### Configuration

- For more details on the options you can pass to `createLogger()`, see the [createLogger reference documentation](/guide/reference/observability/createLogger.mdx).
- Once you have a `Logger` instance, you can call its methods (e.g., `.info()`, `.warn()`, `.error()`) in the [Logger instance reference documentation](/guide/reference/observability/logger.mdx).
- If you need to direct logs to multiple destinations—like both console and an external logging service—see the [createMultiLogger reference documentation](/guide/reference/observability/createMultiLogger.mdx).
- If you want to send your logs to an external service for centralized collection, analysis, or storage, you can configure other logger types such as Upstash Redis. Consult the [createLogger reference documentation](/guide/reference/observability/createLogger.mdx) for details on parameters like `url`, `token`, and `key` when using the `UPSTASH` logger type.
