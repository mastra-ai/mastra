# Project Structure and Organization

This page provides a guide for organizing folders and files in Mastra. Mastra is a modular framework, and you can use any of the modules separately or together.

You could write everything in a single file (as we showed in the quick start), or separate each agent, tool, and workflow into their own files. 

We don't enforce a specific folder structure, but we do recommend some best practices, and the CLI will scaffold a project with a sensible structure.

## Project Setup

To get started with Mastra, follow these steps:

1. **Install the Mastra CLI globally**:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm i -g mastra
```

2. **Initialize your project**:

```bash copy
mastra init
```

The `mastra init` command launches an interactive CLI that will guide you through setting up your project. 

3. **Sign up for an API key (if you don't have one already)**:

- [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/)
- [Anthropic](https://console.anthropic.com/settings/keys)
- [Google Gemini](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
- [Other providers](https://mastra.ai/docs/guide/how-to/00-llm-models#available-models)

Most providers will require a credit card to get an API key. Google Gemini is free to use, but you will need to create a Google Cloud account.

4. **Set your API key in the `.env` file**:

Create a `.env` file in your project root directory and add your API key:

```env
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

Replace `your_openai_api_key` with your actual API key.

## Using the CLI

`mastra init` is an interactive CLI that allows you to:

- **Choose a directory for Mastra files**: Specify where you want the Mastra files to be placed (default is `src/mastra`).
- **Select components to install**: Choose which components you want to include in your project:
  - Agents
  - Tools
  - Workflows
- **Select a default LLM provider**: Choose from supported providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Groq.
- **Include example code**: Decide whether to include example code to help you get started.

### Example Project Structure

Assuming you select all components and include example code, your project structure will look like this:

```
root/
├── src/
│   └── mastra/
│       ├── agents/
│       │   └── index.ts
│       ├── tools/
│       │   └── index.ts
│       ├── workflows/
│       │   └── index.ts
│       ├── index.ts
├── .env
```

### Top-level Folders

| Folder              | Description                          |

| `src/mastra`        | Core application folder              |
| `src/mastra/agents` | Agent configurations and definitions |
| `src/mastra/tools`  | Custom tool definitions              |
| `src/mastra/workflows` | Workflow definitions             |

### Top-level Files

| File                | Description                        |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `src/mastra/index.ts` | Main configuration file for Mastra |
| `.env`              | Environment variables              |
