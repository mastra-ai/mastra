# Adding Tools

Tools are typed functions that can be executed by agents or workflows, with built-in integration access and parameter validation. Each tool has a schema that defines its inputs, an executor function that implements its logic, and access to configured integrations.

## Creating Tools

In this section, we'll walk through the process of creating a tool that can be used by your agents. Let's create a simple tool that fetches current weather information for a given city.

### **Example Tool: Weather Information**

First, let's define a tool that retrieves weather data using a public API.

#### `src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts`

```typescript:src/mastra/tools/weatherInfo.ts
import { createTool } from "@mastra/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const getWeatherInfo = async (city: string) => {
  // Replace with an actual API call to a weather service
  const data = await fetch(`https://api.example.com/weather?city=${city}`).then((r) =>
    r.json(),
  );
  return data;
};

export const weatherInfo = createTool({
  label: "Get Weather Information",
  schema: z.object({
    city: z.string(),
  }),
  description: `Fetches the current weather information for a given city`,
  execute: async ({ data: { city } }) => {
    console.log("Using tool to fetch weather information for", city);
    return await getWeatherInfo(city);
  },
});
```

In this code:

- **`label`**: A human-readable name for the tool.
- **`schema`**: A Zod schema defining the expected input parameters.
- **`description`**: A description of what the tool does.
- **`executor`**: An asynchronous function that performs the tool's main logic.

## Adding Tools to an Agent

Now we'll add the tool to an agent. We'll create an agent that can answer questions about the weather and configure it to use our `weatherInfo` tool.

#### `src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts`

```typescript:src/mastra/agents/weatherAgent.ts
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core";
import * as tools from "../tools";

export const weatherAgent = new Agent<typeof tools>({
  name: "Weather Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful assistant that provides current weather information. When asked about the weather, use the weather information tool to fetch the data.",
  model: {
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4",
    toolChoice: "required",
  },
  enabledTools: {
    weatherInfo: true,
  },
});
```

In this agent configuration:

- **`name`**: A unique name for the agent.
- **`instructions`**: Guidance provided to the agent to define its behavior.
- **`model`**: Specifies the AI model to use.
- **`enabledTools`**: Specifies which tools the agent is allowed to use.

## Setting Up the Mastra Instance

We need to initialize the Mastra instance with our agents and tools.

#### `src/index.ts`

```typescript:src/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { weatherAgent } from "./agents/weatherAgent";
import * as tools from "./tools";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  tools,
  agents: { weatherAgent },
});
```

This registers your agent and tools with Mastra, making them available for use.

## Calling a Tool Directly

Once a tool is added to the Mastra instance, it can be called directly from your application. This is useful for testing tools independently or reusing them in different parts of your application.

#### **Example: Calling the `weatherInfo` Tool Directly**

```typescript
import { mastra } from "./index";

// Retrieve the tool by its name
const weatherInfoTool = mastra.getTool("weatherInfo");

// Execute the tool with the required parameters
const result = await weatherInfoTool.execute({ city: "San Francisco" });

console.log(result);
```

This code demonstrates how to directly invoke the `weatherInfo` tool and output the result.

## Debugging Tools

You can test tools using Jest or any other testing framework. Writing unit tests for your tools ensures they behave as expected and helps catch errors early.

## Calling an Agent with a Tool

Now we can call the agent, and it will use the tool to fetch the weather information.

#### **Example: Interacting with the Agent**

```typescript
import { mastra } from "./index";

async function main() {
  const agent = mastra.getAgent("weatherAgent");
  const response = await agent.generate({
    messages: ["What's the weather like in New York City today?"],
  });

  console.log(response.text);
}

main();
```

The agent will use the `weatherInfo` tool to get the current weather in New York City and respond accordingly.

## Tool Configuration

A tool requires:

- **`label`**: Name of the tool (e.g., "Get Weather Information").
- **`schema`**: Zod schema for validating inputs like city names.
- **`description`**: Clear explanation of what the tool does.
- **`executor`**: Async function that performs the tool's logic.

The executor receives:

- **`data`**: Contains the validated input parameters for your tool.
- **`integrationsRegistry`**: Function to access connected integrations.
- **`runId`**: Unique identifier for the current execution (optional).
- **`agents`**: Access to all registered agents in the system.
- **`engine`**: Reference to the Mastra engine instance (optional).
- **`llm`**: Access to the Language Model instance.
