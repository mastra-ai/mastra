# Agent Memory

Agents in Mastra have a memory that stores conversation history and contextual information. This memory allows agents to maintain state across interactions, enabling more coherent and context-aware responses.

There are three main ways to implement agent memory in Mastra:

1. **In-Memory Storage** (Default)
2. **Using Mastra Engine**
3. **Using External Storage (Redis or PostgreSQL)**

## 1. Default In-Memory Storage

The simplest way to use agent memory is with the default in-memory storage. This means that the agent's memory resides in the application's RAM and is reset whenever the application restarts.

While this is suitable for simple applications, testing, or during initial development phases, it isn't ideal for scenarios where you need to persist memory between sessions or scale across multiple instances.

## 2. Using Mastra Engine

The Mastra engine is a Postgres database that you can install locally using the Mastra CLI. It's a helpful backend for agent memory during development because you can inspect agent memory more easily. 

### Setting Up Mastra Engine for Agent Memory

1. **Install Mastra Engine**:

```bash npm2yarn copy
npm install @mastra/engine
```

2. **Configure Mastra**:

```typescript showLineNumbers
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { mastraEngine } from "@mastra/engine";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  engine: mastraEngine,
  agents: [myAgent],
});
```

3. **Run Mastra Engine**:

```bash
mastra engine up
```

This command sets up the necessary infrastructure for Mastra Engine.

## 3. Using External Storage

For production environments where you need persistent memory across restarts and scalability, you can use external storage backends like Redis or PostgreSQL. 

### Using Redis for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory redis
```

Then, configure your agent to use Redis for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { RedisMemory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { createClient } from "redis";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a Redis client
const redisClient = createClient({
  url: process.env.REDIS_URL, // e.g., "redis://localhost:6379"
});

redisClient.connect();

const redisMemory = new RedisMemory({
  client: redisClient,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: redisMemory,
  agents: [myAgent],
});
```

Ensure you have your Redis URL set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
REDIS_URL=redis://your_redis_server_url
```

### Using PostgreSQL for Agent Memory

First, install the necessary packages:

```bash
npm install @mastra/memory pg
```

Then, configure your agent to use PostgreSQL for memory storage:

```typescript
// src/mastra/index.ts
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";
import { PostgresMemory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { Pool } from "pg";

import { myAgent } from "./agents";

// Create a PostgreSQL pool
const pgPool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING,
});

const pgMemory = new PostgresMemory({
  pool: pgPool,
});

export const mastra = new Mastra({
  memory: pgMemory,
  agents: [myAgent],
});
```

Ensure you have your PostgreSQL connection string set in your environment variables:

```env
# .env
POSTGRES_CONNECTION_STRING=postgresql://user:password@localhost:5432/your_database
```

## Managing Agent Memory

Once your agent is configured with a memory backend, you can manage its memory using the following methods.

### Saving the Agent's Memory

Save the agent's memory state with a unique identifier:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.save("memory_id");
```

This persists the current memory state, allowing you to reload it later.

### Loading the Agent's Memory

Load a previously saved memory state:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.load("memory_id");
```

This replaces the agent's current memory with the saved state associated with `memory_id`.

### Clearing the Agent's Memory

To clear the agent's memory, removing all stored messages and context:

```typescript
await myAgent.memory.clear();
```

This resets the agent's memory to an empty state.
