# REST Endpoints

Mastra provides a development server that exposes REST endpoints for your agents, tools and workflows.

## Starting the Development Server

To start the server, you use the `mastra dev` command:

```bash
mastra dev
```

The server:

- Runs on port 4111 by default
- Loads environment from `.env.development` or `.env`

**Note:** Ensure that you have set the necessary environment variables, such as your OpenAI API key, in your `.env` or `.env.development` file:

```.env filename=".env" copy
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
```

## OpenAPI Documentation

You can access the OpenAPI documentation at `http://localhost:4111/openapi.json`.
