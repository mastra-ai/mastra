# The Mastra class

In building your app, you will need to call client APIs, sync data, and so on.

The [Mastra framework class](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/blob/main/packages/core/src/framework.ts) is the main entry point for interacting with events and data from Mastra. It provides a set of methods for interacting with the framework, such as events, apis, and workflows.

## Initializing

`Mastra.init(config)`

This takes your config file and returns an instantiated instance of Mastra.

Convention is to assign this to a variable called `mastra`, for example:

```ts
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

import { config } from '../mastra.config';

const mastra = Mastra.init(config);
```

## Apis

`callApi`

This calls a specific third-party API.

## Workflows

`runBlueprint`

This runs a specific workflow blueprint stored in the `mastra/blueprints` folder.
