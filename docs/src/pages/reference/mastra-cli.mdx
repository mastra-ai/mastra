# The Mastra CLI

The Mastra CLI has the following commands:

### `mastra init`

This initializes your project, creating a number of different files, including `mastra.config.ts`, `mastra.docker-compose.yaml`, and adding a `.env.development` file for storing your environment variables.

This prompts you for your Postgres and Inngest connection strings, and spins up a Docker container with the resources you don't have.

### `mastra migrate`

This migrates your Postgres database to add [Mastra's schema](./data-layer.mdx) to it so it can store synced records. This might be needed after updating mastra or to provision a new database.

### `mastra dev`

This spins up the Mastra admin console, which you can use to create agents, install integrations, manage synced records, and trigger workflows.

You can pass in a `-e` or `--env` flag with the namve of another env file (e.g. "production" to reference ".env.production"). This makes it easy to switch between different environments within the admin console.

### `mastra generate`

This generates (or regenerates) the Typescript types and Prisma client. You might need to run this after updating mastra.

### `mastra build`

This builds the admin console and is useful if you would like to deploy the admin console to a hosting provider.

_IMPORTANT:_ There are currently no authentication measures within admin so please make sure to password-protect or secure your deployed site.
