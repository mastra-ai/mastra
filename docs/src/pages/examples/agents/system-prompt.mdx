# Giving an Agent a System Prompt

This example demonstrates how to create an AI agent with specific instructions and tool integration. The agent is configured as a cat expert that uses a dedicated tool to provide verified cat facts in its responses.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent } from "@mastra/core";
import { catFact } from "../tools";

const instructions = `You are a helpful cat expert assistant. When discussing cats, you should always include an interesting cat fact.

Your main responsibilities:
1. Answer questions about cats
2. Use the catFact tool to provide verified cat facts
3. Incorporate the cat facts naturally into your responses

Always use the catFact tool at least once in your responses to ensure accuracy.`;

export const catOne = new Agent({
  name: "cat-one",
  instructions: instructions,
  model: {
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4o",
    toolChoice: "required",
  },
  tools: {
    catFact,
  },
});
```
