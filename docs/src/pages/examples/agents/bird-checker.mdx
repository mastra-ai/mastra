# Making a Bird Checker

We will get a random image from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) that matches a selected query and uses a [Mastra AI Agent](https://mastra.ai/docs/guide/creating-agents/00-overview) to determine if it is a bird or not

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Agent, createTool } from "@mastra/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const instructions = `
  You can view an image and figure out if it is a bird or not. 
  You can also figure out the species of the bird and where the picture was taken.
`;

export const birdCheckerAgent = new Agent({
  name: 'Bird checker',
  instructions,
  model: {
    provider: 'ANTHROPIC',
    name: 'claude-3-haiku-20240307',
    toolChoice: 'auto',
  },
});

// Get the image url from Unsplash
const imageUrl = getRandomImage();

const response = await birdCheckerAgent.generate(
  [
    {
        role: 'user',
        content: [
        {
            type: 'image',
            image: imageUrl,
        },
        {
            type: 'text',
            text: "view this image and let me know if it's a bird or not, and the scientific name of the bird without any explanation. Also summarize the location for this picture in one or two short sentences understandable by a high school student",
        },
        ],
    },
    ],
    {
    output: z.object({
        bird: z.boolean(),
        species: z.string(),
        location: z.string(),
    }),
  },
);

console.log(response.text);
