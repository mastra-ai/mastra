# Tree of Thought Prompting

Tree of thought prompting helps models explore multiple solution paths simultaneously. Here's how to implement it in Mastra:

```typescript
import { createPrompt } from "@mastra/core";

type ProblemSolvingVars = {
  problem: string;
};

const problemSolver = createPrompt<ProblemSolvingVars>(
  "Solve complex problem",
  {
    persona: "Problem Solver",
    outputFormat: "markdown",
  },
)
  .text("Solve this problem:\n\n{{problem}}")
  .thinking({
    branches: {
      "Technical Solution": [
        "Analyze technical requirements",
        "Consider implementation options",
        "Evaluate technical tradeoffs",
      ],
      "User Experience": [
        "Identify user needs",
        "Design user interactions",
        "Consider accessibility",
      ],
      "Business Impact": [
        "Assess costs",
        "Evaluate timeline",
        "Consider scalability",
      ],
    },
  });

// Usage example
const solution = problemSolver.toString({
  problem:
    "Design a new feature for uploading and processing large files in a web application",
});
```

## Key Features

1. **Parallel Exploration**: Uses `branches` to explore multiple aspects simultaneously
2. **Structured Thinking**: Each branch follows its own logical progression
3. **Comprehensive Analysis**: Considers different perspectives (technical, UX, business)
4. **Balanced Decision Making**: Helps evaluate tradeoffs across different solution paths
