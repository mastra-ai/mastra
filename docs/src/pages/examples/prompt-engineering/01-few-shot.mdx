# Few-Shot Learning

Few-shot learning helps models understand patterns through examples. Here's how to implement it effectively in Mastra:

```typescript
import { createPrompt } from "@mastra/core";

type SentimentVars = {
  text: string;
  language: string;
};

const sentimentPrompt = createPrompt<SentimentVars>("Analyze sentiment", {
  persona: "Language Analyst",
  outputFormat: "json",
})
  .text("Analyze the sentiment of this {{language}} text:\n\n{{text}}")
  .examples([
    {
      input: {
        text: "The product exceeded my expectations, highly recommend!",
        language: "English",
      },
      output: {
        sentiment: "positive",
        confidence: 0.95,
        aspects: ["product quality", "recommendation"],
      },
    },
    {
      input: {
        text: "Service was okay, but the wait time was too long",
        language: "English",
      },
      output: {
        sentiment: "mixed",
        confidence: 0.8,
        aspects: ["service quality", "wait time"],
      },
    },
  ])
  .constraints([
    "Follow the exact output format from examples",
    "Include confidence score",
    "Identify key aspects mentioned",
  ]);

// Usage example
const analysis = sentimentPrompt.toString({
  text: "Great features but the interface could be more intuitive",
  language: "English",
});
```

## Key Features

1. **Multiple Examples**: Provide diverse examples covering different cases
2. **Consistent Format**: Maintain the same output structure across examples
3. **Clear Patterns**: Show patterns through examples rather than explicit rules
4. **Structured Output**: Use JSON or other structured formats for consistency
