# Chain of Thought Prompting

Chain of thought prompting helps models break down complex problems into steps. Here's how to implement it in Mastra:

```typescript
import { createPrompt } from "@mastra/core";

type WordProblemVars = {
  problem: string;
};

const mathSolver = createPrompt<WordProblemVars>("Solve word problem", {
  persona: "Math Teacher",
  outputFormat: "markdown",
})
  .text("Solve this word problem:\n\n{{problem}}")
  .thinking({
    autoChainOfThought: true,
    steps: [
      "Read and understand the problem",
      "Identify important information",
      "Choose the right operation",
      "Solve step by step",
      "Check the answer",
    ],
  });

// Usage example
const solution = mathSolver.toString({
  problem:
    "If a store sells 12 apples per hour and is open for 8 hours, how many apples do they sell in a day?",
});
```

## Key Features

1. **Step-by-Step Thinking**: The `thinking` property defines explicit steps for problem-solving
2. **Auto Chain of Thought**: Enable `autoChainOfThought` to encourage step-by-step reasoning
3. **Examples with Reasoning**: Provide examples that demonstrate the thought process
