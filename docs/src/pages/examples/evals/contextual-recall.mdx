# Contextual Recall

This example demonstrates how to use Mastra's Contextual Recall metric to evaluate how well responses remember and use provided context information.

## Overview

The example shows how to:

1. Set up a Mastra agent for generating responses
2. Configure the Contextual Recall metric
3. Evaluate context recall effectiveness
4. Analyze recall scores

## Setup

### Environment Setup

Make sure to set up your environment variables:

```bash filename=".env"
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

### Dependencies

Import the necessary dependencies:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
import { openai } from '@ai-sdk/openai';
import { Agent } from '@mastra/core/agent';
import { ContextualRecallMetric } from '@mastra/evals/llm';
```

## Agent Creation

Create a Mastra agent for generating responses:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="src/index.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: 'Example Agent',
  instructions: 'You are a helpful assistant that provides informative answers.',
  model: openai('gpt-4o-mini'),
});
```

## Metric Configuration

Set up the Contextual Recall metric with context:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers{7} filename="src/index.ts"
const metric = new ContextualRecallMetric(openai('gpt-4o-mini'), {
  scale: 1,
  context: [
    'The Great Wall of China was built over 2,000 years.',
    'The wall spans approximately 13,171 miles.',
    'Construction began during the 7th century BCE.',
    'Multiple dynasties contributed to its construction.',
  ],
});
```

## Example Usage

### High Recall Example

Evaluate comprehensive historical information recall:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
const query1 = 'Tell me about the Great Wall of China.';
const response1 = await agent.generate(query1, { context: context1.join(' ') });

const result1 = await metric1.measure(query1, response1.text);
console.log('High Recall Result:', {
  score: result1.score,
  reason: result1.info.reason,
});
```

### Partial Recall Example

Evaluate technical information recall:

```typescript copy showLineNumbers filename="src/index.ts"
const context2 = [
  'DNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is a molecule that carries genetic information.',
  'DNA has a double helix structure.',
  'It contains four nucleotide bases: A, T, C, and G.',
  'DNA replication is essential for cell division.',
];

const query2 = 'What is DNA and what does it do?';
const response2 = await agent.generate(query2, { context: context2.join(' ') });

const result2 = await metric2.measure(query2, response2.text);
console.log('Partial Recall Result:', {
  score: result2.score,
  reason: result2.info.reason,
});
```

## Understanding the Results

The metric provides:

1. A recall score between 0 and 1:
   - 1.0: Perfect recall
   - 0.7-0.9: High recall
   - 0.4-0.6: Moderate recall
   - 0.1-0.3: Low recall
   - 0.0: No recall

2. Detailed analysis of:
   - What information was recalled
   - How accurately it was used
   - Missing or incomplete information
