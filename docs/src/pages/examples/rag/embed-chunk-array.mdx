# Embed Chunk Array

This example shows you how to embed an array of chunks. By using the `embed` method, you can embed the chunks into a vector database, which can be used for various purposes, such as search or retrieval.

```tsx copy
import { MDocument, embed } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = MDocument.fromText("Your text content...");

const chunks = await doc.chunk();

const { embeddings } = await embed(chunks, {
  provider: "OPEN_AI",
  model: "text-embedding-ada-002",
  maxRetries: 3,
});
```
