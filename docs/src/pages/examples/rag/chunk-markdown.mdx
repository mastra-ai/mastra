# Chunk Markdown

This example shows you how to chunk Markdown content. By using the `chunk` method, you can split the Markdown into smaller pieces, which can be used for various purposes, such as search or retrieval.

```tsx copy
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = MDocument.fromMarkdown("# Your markdown content...");

const chunks = await doc.chunk();
```
