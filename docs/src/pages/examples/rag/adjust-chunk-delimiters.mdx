# Adjust Chunk Delimiters

This example shows you how to adjust the chunk delimiters for a document. By default, the chunk delimiter is set to `\n`, but you can change it to any string you want.

```tsx copy
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = MDocument.fromText("Your plain text content...");

const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  separator: "\n",
});
```
