# Chunk JSON

This example shows you how to chunk JSON content. By using the `chunk` method, you can split the JSON into smaller pieces, which can be used for various purposes, such as search or retrieval.

```tsx copy
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const testJson = {
  name: "John Doe",
  age: 30,
  email: "john.doe@example.com",
};

const doc = MDocument.fromJSON(JSON.stringify(testJson));

const chunks = await doc.chunk();
```
