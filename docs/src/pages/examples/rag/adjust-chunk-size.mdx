# Adjust Chunk Size

This example shows you how to adjust the chunk size for a document. By default, the chunk size is set to 1024, but you can change it to any number you want.

```tsx copy
import { MDocument } from "@mastra/rag";

const doc = MDocument.fromText("Your plain text content...");

const chunks = await doc.chunk({
  size: 512,
});
```
