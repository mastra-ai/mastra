# Generate Text

This example demonstrates how to interact with OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model through the Mastra library for basic text generation. After providing a prompt—in this case, "What is a wormhole?"—the GPT-4 model returns a textual response that you can handle programmatically.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: 'OPEN_AI',
  name: 'gpt-4',
});

const response = await llm.generate('What is a wormhole?');

console.log(response.text);
```
