# Generate Text with Claude

This example demonstrates how to interact with Anthropic’s Claude language model through the Mastra library for basic text generation. After providing a prompt—in this case, "Who invented the submarine?"—the Claude model returns a textual response that you can handle programmatically.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';
import { z } from 'zod';

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: 'ANTHROPIC',
  name: 'claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022',
});

const result = await llm.generate('Who invented the submarine?');

console.log(result.text);
```
