# Generate Text with System Prompt

This example shows you how to generate text by providing a system prompt, which sets the overall instructions for the language model. In this case, the system role prompts the model to act as a helpful assistant, and then the user asks a question, such as “What is the meaning of life?”. The response from the language model is then captured and logged.

```ts showLineNumbers
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: 'OPEN_AI',
  name: 'gpt-4',
});

const response = await llm.generate([
  { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant.' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'What is the meaning of life?' },
]);

console.log(response.text);
```
