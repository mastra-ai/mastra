# Generate Text with Deepseek Reasoner

This example shows how to use Deepseek's reasoner model to solve complex logical problems with step-by-step reasoning.

## Code Example

```typescript
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: 'DEEPSEEK',
  name: 'deepseek-reasoner',
  apiKey: process.env.DEEPSEEK_API_KEY,
});

const response = await llm.generate('Solve this logical puzzle step by step: Three friends - Alice, Bob, and Charlie - are wearing different colored hats (red, blue, green). Alice says she sees a blue hat. Bob says he sees a green hat. Charlie says he sees a red hat. Each person can see the others\' hats but not their own. If exactly one person is lying, what color hat is each person wearing?');

console.log(response.text);
```

## Configuration

To use this example, you'll need:

1. A Deepseek API key (set as `DEEPSEEK_API_KEY` in your environment)
2. The `@mastra/core` package installed

The Deepseek reasoner model is specifically designed for tasks that require logical reasoning and step-by-step problem solving. It excels at:
- Mathematical problems
- Logic puzzles
- Step-by-step analysis
- Complex reasoning tasks
