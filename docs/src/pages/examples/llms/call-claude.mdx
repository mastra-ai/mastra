# Generate Text with Claude

Many developers need to use different language models but don't want to learn multiple APIs. Mastra provides a unified interface for working with various LLM providers, handling the complexity of different API implementations. This example shows how to use Anthropic's Claude model through the same interface used for other providers.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from "@mastra/core";

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: "ANTHROPIC",
  name: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022",
});

const result = await llm.generate("Who invented the submarine?");

console.log(result.text);
```
