# Stream Text

This example shows you how to stream text from a language model. By using the `stream` method, you can capture the model's response in real-time, allowing you to handle the output incrementally.

```ts showLineNumbers copy
import { Mastra } from '@mastra/core';

const mastra = new Mastra();

const llm = mastra.LLM({
  provider: 'OPEN_AI',
  name: 'gpt-4',
});

const response = await llm.stream('Tell me about christmas and it"s traditions');

for await (const chunk of stream.textStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```
