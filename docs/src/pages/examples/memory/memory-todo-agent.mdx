# Todo List Agent with Working Memory

This example demonstrates how to create an agent that maintains a todo list using working memory, even with minimal context.

## Setup

First, set up the memory system with LibSQL storage and a working memory template for the todo list:

```typescript
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { MastraStorageLibSql } from "@mastra/core/storage";

const memory = new Memory({
  storage: new MastraStorageLibSql({
    config: {
      url: "file:example.db",
    },
  }),
  options: {
    lastMessages: 1, // Only keep the last message in context
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      template: `
<todolist>
  <info>this is an example list - replace it with whatever the user needs</info>
  <item status="ACTIVE" due="Feb 7 3028" title="Example" started="Feb 7 2025">example</item>
</todolist>
`,
    },
  },
});

// Create the todo list agent
const todoAgent = new Agent({
  name: "TODO Agent",
  instructions:
    "You are a helpful todolist AI agent. Help the user manage their todolist. If there is no list yet ask them what to add! If there is a list always print it out when the chat starts. For each item add emojis, dates, titles (with an index number starting at 1), descriptions, and statuses. For each piece of info add an emoji to the left of it. Also support subtask lists with bullet points inside a box. Help the user timebox each task by asking them how long it will take.",
  model: {
    provider: "OPEN_AI",
    name: "gpt-4o-mini",
    toolChoice: "auto",
  },
  memory,
});
```

## Usage Example

Here's how to interact with the todo agent:

```typescript
import { randomUUID } from "crypto";
import { maskStreamTags } from "@mastra/core/utils";

// Start a conversation
const threadId = randomUUID();
const resourceId = "SOME_USER_ID";

// Add a new todo item
const response = await todoAgent.stream(
  "Add a task: Build a new feature for our app. It should take about 2 hours and needs to be done by next Friday.",
  {
    threadId,
    resourceId,
  },
);

// Mask working memory updates in the response
const maskedStream = maskStreamTags(response.textStream, "working_memory", {
  onStart: () => showLoadingSpinner("Updating todo list..."),
  onEnd: () => hideLoadingSpinner(),
  onMask: (chunk) => console.debug("Updated todo list:", chunk),
});

// Process the masked stream
for await (const chunk of maskedStream) {
  process.stdout.write(chunk);
}
```

The example demonstrates:

1. Setting up a memory system with working memory enabled
2. Creating a todo list template with structured XML
3. Using `maskStreamTags` to hide memory updates from users
4. Providing UI feedback during memory updates with lifecycle hooks

Even with only one message in context (`lastMessages: 1`), the agent maintains the complete todo list in working memory. Each time the agent responds, it updates the working memory with the current state of the todo list, ensuring persistence across interactions.
