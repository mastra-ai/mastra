# Mastra Framework

{/* [![Mastra framework homepage](mastra-homepage.png)](https://mastra.ai) */}

Mastra lets you prototype and productionize AI features quickly with a modern JS/TS stack.

- **Workflows**: Chain calls to OpenAI, Anthropic, Google. Pipe output between steps. Create graphs with `workflow.addStep()` and `step.connect()`.
- **RAG pipeline**: Sync data into a vector DB (Pinecone). Mastra integrates with 50+ SaaS services, web scrapers, etc.
- **Agents**: provide LLM models with tools, workflows, and synced data.

Mastra uses Inngest and Prisma to store and sync data into vector databases. It includes an admin panel for exploring data, a playground for testing actions, a chat UI for agents, and a visual workflow builder with variables, conditions, and branching.

The setup is completely self- contained and runs on your local machine. In production, you can self-host or deploy to Vercel/Netlify.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (version 20 or later)
- Docker (the daemon should be running)

### Installing Next.js

Start by creating a new Next.js App Router project in TypeScript. You can initialize one quickly with

```bash
npx create-next-app --ts --eslint --src-dir --tailwind --import-alias "@/*" --app
```

Once installed, follow the steps below:

<Steps>

### Install global CLI

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install -g mastra
```

### Add the core package

From the root of your Next.js project:

```bash copy npm2yarn
npm install @mastra/core
```

### Initialize your project:

```bash copy
mastra init
```

Provision local resources:

```console
$ Enter your PostgreSQL connection string (postgresql://username:password@host:port/database) or press Enter to create a new instance:
$ Enter your Inngest server URL or press Enter to create a new instance:
```

### Run the Mastra dev server:

```bash copy
mastra dev
```

</Steps>

## Configuration

After initialization, you'll find an `mastra.config.ts` file in your project root. You can find the full list of configuration options in the [Mastra config docs](./reference/mastra-config.mdx) and a reference of the files Mastra owns in the [Local File Structure docs](./reference/local-project-structure.mdx).

## Deployment

Mastra's data syncing infrastructure is designed for Next.js sites running on serverless hosting providers like Vercel or Netlify.

Job queues are managed with [Inngest](https://inngest.com/), which can be self-hosted or run as a managed service.

Logs can be configured to be written to the console, written to the filesystem, or stored in [Upstash](https://upstash.com/).
