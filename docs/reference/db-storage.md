# DB Storage

Kepler stores synced records in your Postgres database. 

In order to allow you to continue to control migrations on your database, while letting Kepler use it to sync data into, Kepler uses the Postgres concept of [schemas](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-schemas.html). 

For more details, look at `/src/prisma/schema.prisma` in the core package.

## Records

| id               | String                 | Unique identifier for the record, automatically generated using CUID         |
| externalId       | String (optional)      | An optional external identifier for the record                               |
