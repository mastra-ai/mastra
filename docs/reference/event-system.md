# The Kepler Event System

Kepler exposes an event bus, which can be used to trigger events from integrations as well as custom events your app defines. 

The admin console includes an integration playground, which allows you to browse events from the integrations you've installed, as well as trigger them and see your application's response.

## Creating your own events

Kepler allows your app to define its own custom events, which can be used to trigger workflows, or which you can listen for in your own code.
