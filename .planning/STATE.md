## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Storage domain: New DatasetsStorage follows existing pattern (workflows, memory, scores)
- Auto-versioning: Items changes increment version automatically (simpler UX than explicit)
- Scorers passed to run: Separates concerns, allows different scoring per experiment
- Input stored as unknown: Target adapter normalizes at execution time
- Defer virtual folders: Organizational polish, not core workflow (v1.1)
