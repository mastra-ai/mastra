/**
 * `InngestRun` (the general Workflow API, see `run.ts`) and `createInngestAgent`
 * (the durable-agent wrapper, see `durable-agent/create-inngest-agent.ts`) both
 * fire the same `workflow.<id>` event directly via `inngest.send()` instead of
 * one delegating to the other. Every per-call trust/context signal that needs
 * to survive the durable boundary (`requestContext`, `actor`) has to be built
 * into the event payload identically in both places, or one path silently
 * drops it — this is exactly what happened with `actor` (missing entirely from
 * createInngestAgent) and `requestContext` (hardcoded to `{}` there, see #19223
 * and #19426/actor). Route any such signal through the helpers below from both
 * call sites so a future addition can't go out of sync the same way.
