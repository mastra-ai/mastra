# Memory Documentation Feedback Assessment

Based on the user feedback collected and our new documentation drafts, here are the key improvements needed to address user questions and concerns.

## General Documentation Issues
- Need more practical, real-world examples instead of abstract examples
- Clearer explanation of what Memory is and how it works at a high level
- Better explanation of when to use different Memory features

## Specific Gaps to Address

### Resource/Thread Model Confusion
- Ata's feedback shows confusion about the resourceId/threadId model
- Need clearer explanation of why both IDs are required, not just threadId
- Explain relationship between threads and users better (one user can have multiple threads)
- Add diagrams showing how these IDs map to real-world usage

### Frontend Integration Issues
- Ata and ninapepite had issues with useChat integration
- Document the message formatting issues with useChat (currently requires sending only the latest message)
- Add complete frontend examples with proper request/response handling
- Include better error handling for memory operations

### Working Memory Confusion
- Bruce and juspky had questions about how working memory is shared
- Users don't understand if working memory is per-agent or per-thread
- Need to clarify how agents update working memory and what happens when templates aren't followed
- Explain differences between text-stream and tool-call modes better

### Database Configuration
- Several users (Ata, satvik, mundume) had trouble with database setup
- Need clearer examples of database setup for different environments
- Explain migration path from development to production
- Document common database issues and troubleshooting steps

### Deployment Challenges
- cristiandley and jpvaillancourt had deployment issues
- Need specific documentation on deploying memory to various platforms (Vercel, etc.)
- Address serverless function limitations and workarounds
- Provide connection pooling strategies for different platforms

### Multiple Agents Sharing Memory
- Ata and Bruce were confused about configuring multiple agents with memory
- Clarify whether to create one Memory instance per agent or share Memory between agents
- Explain how to share context between agents or ensure proper isolation

### Installation Issues
- Bruce had installation problems with pnpm vs npm
- Document package installation clearly including dependencies
- Mention the need to install @mastra/memory separately 

### Resource Consumption
- Ata mentioned serverless function memory limits
- Add guidance on optimizing memory usage in constrained environments
- Provide strategies for reducing vector storage size

## Recommendations for Documentation Structure
1. Start with a clear "What is Memory?" conceptual overview
2. Provide a simple quickstart guide with minimal configuration
3. Include complete, working examples for common patterns
4. Add a troubleshooting section addressing common issues
5. Provide clear deployment guides for different environments
6. Create a FAQ section based on Discord user questions
