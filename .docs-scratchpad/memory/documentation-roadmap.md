- **Memory Size Concerns**: Bundle size and memory usage in serverless environments

### Multi-Agent Integration

- **Memory Sharing**: How multiple agents can share or isolate memory (Ata, Bruce)
- **Workflow Integration**: How memory works in workflow steps with multiple agents
- **Context Passing**: Techniques for sharing memory context between agents

### Installation and Troubleshooting

- **Package Manager Issues**: pnpm vs npm installation problems (Bruce)
