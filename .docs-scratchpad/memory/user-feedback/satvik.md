is it cuz of monorepo?
Im using the client sdk, why would it require tokenizer? It wouldn't need to download the model right? and im running mastra on the cloud

React being in the path is a pnpm thing - for the error though I'm not really sure. @Ward could this be from recent bundling changes?

Lemme know if you get any info. I remember dero is working on the client sdk. Pulling him in just incase he knows anything. @dero

i think we have react hooks in our client sdk, i'll sync with @dero

hmm, we actually don't have react hooks directly in the SDK, i'lll investigate

Can i manually put the tokenizer into the path?
a quick fix for now?
dero â€” 2025-03-21, 8:38â€¯AM
Yeah "Tokenizer not found" seems to be from the server
Looks like an issue with the default embedder
maybe it's still something with the build like @Tyler said, cc @Ward

Im hosting the model in the mastra cloud. I don't see any logs of it but could you check it once

is it cuz im using mastra cloud in memory?
Ward â€” 2025-03-21, 9:39â€¯AM
need to check, memory was working fine for me
Tyler â€” 2025-03-21, 10:52â€¯AM
This would be when using default embedder w/ memory. @satvik as a workaround you can use new Memory({ embedder: openai.embedding('text-embedding-3-small') })
