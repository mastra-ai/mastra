# Memory Documentation Feedback Checklist

This checklist tracks specific improvements needed in our memory documentation based on user feedback.

## Overview Section
- [x] Add clearer explanation of what Memory is conceptually
- [x] Explain the relationship between Memory, context window, and LLM capabilities 
- [ ] Add more diagrams to visualize Memory architecture
- [x] Explain when to use different Memory features (threads, working memory, semantic recall)

## Getting Started
- [x] Add installation instructions for different package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn)
- [x] Make it clear that @mastra/memory needs to be installed separately
- [x] Improve the basic setup example to show a complete implementation
- [x] Add troubleshooting for common installation issues

## Core Concepts
- [x] Clarify why both resourceId and threadId are required (Ata's feedback)
- [x] Explain the relationship between users and threads better
- [ ] Add diagrams showing resource/thread model in practical applications
- [x] Explain thread management in a multi-user environment
- [x] Clarify how working memory is scoped (per thread, not per agent)

## Frontend Integration
- [x] Document useChat integration with detailed examples (Ata, ninapepite)
- [x] Explain message formatting issues and best practices
- [x] Provide complete frontend + backend code examples
- [x] Include authentication integration with memory
- [x] Address common errors and provide solutions

## Database Configuration
- [x] Add step-by-step setup guides for each database option
- [x] Include production configuration examples with connection pooling
- [x] Provide migration strategies from development to production
- [x] Improve troubleshooting section for database issues

## Deployment
- [x] Add specific guides for deploying to Vercel (Ata's serverless issues)
- [x] Document serverless function limitations and workarounds
- [x] Provide connection pooling strategies for different environments
- [x] Add environment-specific configuration examples

## Multi-Agent Systems
- [x] Clarify whether to create one Memory instance per agent or share Memory
- [x] Explain how to share context between agents
- [x] Provide examples of accessing the same memory from different agents
- [x] Document thread isolation vs. sharing strategies

## Examples
- [x] Create practical, real-world examples based on user feedback
- [ ] Add a to-do list memory example (similar to Ata's use case)
- [ ] Create a travel itinerary example (mentioned by Ata)
- [x] Add a multi-agent memory sharing example (needed by Bruce)
- [x] Create a chat application example with proper memory integration

## FAQ
- [x] Create FAQ based on Discord questions
- [x] Add section on memory debugging and troubleshooting
- [x] Include performance optimization strategies
- [x] Document resource consumption management
- [x] Address working memory template limitations
