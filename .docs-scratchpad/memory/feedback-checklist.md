# Memory Documentation Feedback Checklist

This checklist tracks specific improvements needed in our memory documentation based on user feedback.

## Overview Section
- [ ] Add clearer explanation of what Memory is conceptually
- [ ] Explain the relationship between Memory, context window, and LLM capabilities 
- [ ] Add more diagrams to visualize Memory architecture
- [ ] Explain when to use different Memory features (threads, working memory, semantic recall)

## Getting Started
- [ ] Add installation instructions for different package managers (npm, pnpm, yarn)
- [ ] Make it clear that @mastra/memory needs to be installed separately
- [ ] Improve the basic setup example to show a complete implementation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting for common installation issues

## Core Concepts
- [ ] Clarify why both resourceId and threadId are required (Ata's feedback)
- [ ] Explain the relationship between users and threads better
- [ ] Add diagrams showing resource/thread model in practical applications
- [ ] Explain thread management in a multi-user environment
- [ ] Clarify how working memory is scoped (per thread, not per agent)

## Frontend Integration
- [ ] Document useChat integration with detailed examples (Ata, ninapepite)
- [ ] Explain message formatting issues and best practices
- [ ] Provide complete frontend + backend code examples
- [ ] Include authentication integration with memory
- [ ] Address common errors and provide solutions

## Database Configuration
- [ ] Add step-by-step setup guides for each database option
- [ ] Include production configuration examples with connection pooling
- [ ] Provide migration strategies from development to production
- [ ] Improve troubleshooting section for database issues

## Deployment
- [ ] Add specific guides for deploying to Vercel (Ata's serverless issues)
- [ ] Document serverless function limitations and workarounds
- [ ] Provide connection pooling strategies for different environments
- [ ] Add environment-specific configuration examples

## Multi-Agent Systems
- [ ] Clarify whether to create one Memory instance per agent or share Memory
- [ ] Explain how to share context between agents
- [ ] Provide examples of accessing the same memory from different agents
- [ ] Document thread isolation vs. sharing strategies

## Examples
- [ ] Create practical, real-world examples based on user feedback
- [ ] Add a to-do list memory example (similar to Ata's use case)
- [ ] Create a travel itinerary example (mentioned by Ata)
- [ ] Add a multi-agent memory sharing example (needed by Bruce)
- [ ] Create a chat application example with proper memory integration

## FAQ
- [ ] Create FAQ based on Discord questions
- [ ] Add section on memory debugging and troubleshooting
- [ ] Include performance optimization strategies
- [ ] Document resource consumption management
- [ ] Address working memory template limitations
