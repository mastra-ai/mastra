# Mastra Playground Interface for Memory Management

**Use Case**: Using the Mastra Playground UI to explore and manage memory threads and conversation history.

**Why Users Need This**:
- View and navigate conversation threads in a visual interface
- Test memory features without building a custom UI
- Debug memory-related issues during development
- Demonstrate memory capabilities to stakeholders

**Implementation Example**:
```bash
# Start the Mastra development server with playground
npx mastra dev

# The playground UI is available at http://localhost:4111
```

**Key Playground Memory Features**:
- Thread navigation panel showing all conversation threads
- Ability to create new threads for testing
- View full conversation history within threads
- Test semantic search on past conversations
- Observe working memory updates in real-time
- Reset conversation context for testing

The playground provides a visual representation of how memory is being utilized, making it easier to understand the flow of information and debug memory-related issues during development. It's particularly useful for:

1. Demonstrating memory persistence across page refreshes
2. Verifying that semantic search correctly retrieves relevant past messages 
3. Inspecting working memory structure and updates
4. Testing memory with different conversation patterns
