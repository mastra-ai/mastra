# Mastra Memory - Use Cases

This document provides an overview of the most common use cases for memory in Mastra agents, based on typical needs and patterns observed in agent applications.

## Use Cases

1. [Persistent Conversation History](./persistent-conversation-history.md) - Maintaining conversational context across multiple interactions with the same user

2. [Knowledge Retention with Working Memory](./knowledge-retention-with-working-memory.md) - Remembering important user information without keeping full conversation history

3. [Memory-Augmented RAG](./memory-augmented-rag.md) - Using memory to enhance Retrieval-Augmented Generation processes

4. [Multi-User Context Management](./multi-user-context-management.md) - Managing separate conversation threads for different users

5. [Optimizing Context Windows](./optimizing-context-windows.md) - Filtering and transforming recalled messages to prevent context overflow

6. [Cross-Session Memory Transfer](./cross-session-memory-transfer.md) - Transferring relevant context between different threads or agents

9 [Memory-Driven Plan Tracking](./memory-driven-plan-tracking.md) - Tracking progress of multi-step plans or roadmaps

10. [Memory-Powered Workflows](./memory-powered-workflows.md) - Integrating memory with workflows for context-aware processes

11. [Playground Interface](./playground-interface.md) - Using the Mastra Playground UI for memory management

## How These Use Cases Impact Documentation

These use cases highlight the need for:

1. **Clear entry points** for different memory needs
2. **Progressive complexity** in documentation (basic â†’ advanced)
3. **Task-oriented examples** that match real-world usage
4. **Mental models** that help users understand how memory works
5. **Debugging assistance** for common memory-related issues
