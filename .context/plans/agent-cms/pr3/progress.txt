## In Progress:
(none yet)

## Notes:
- This PR depends on PR1 (Dynamic Agents UI) being merged first
- Key providers: Composio, Arcade, MCP, Smithery
- OAuth flows required for Composio and Arcade
- MCP supports both HTTP and Stdio transports

## Blockers:
(none yet)

- Task 011: Copy tool ID utilities
  - Copied tool-id.ts from total-cms:packages/core/src/integrations/tool-id.ts
  - Added utility functions for generating and parsing integration tool IDs
  - Tool IDs follow format: provider_toolkitSlug_toolSlug

  - Generic executeTool function routes to appropriate provider
  - MCP/Smithery execution requires @mastra/server package (not implemented in core)
  - File: packages/core/src/integrations/tool-executor.ts
  - Status: Complete ✓

- Task 012: Copy integrations module index
  - Copied index.ts from total-cms:packages/core/src/integrations/index.ts

- Task 014: Update Mastra class with integrations
  - Analysis: No changes needed to Mastra class for integration support
  - Reason: The `integrationTools` field already exists in `StorageAgentType` (added in task 001)
  - The Mastra class already resolves all fields from StorageAgentType when creating agents
  - Integration tool execution happens via the tool executor (task 010) and doesn't require Mastra class changes
  - The diff from total-cms includes scorer-related changes from PR2, which are not applicable to PR3
  - Verified typecheck passes without any changes
  - File: packages/core/src/mastra/index.ts

    - Added integrations domain to composition logic
    - Added integrations init to init() method
  - Added stub methods to Mastra class (packages/core/src/mastra/index.ts):

    - getToolProviderStatuses(): Promise<any[]> - returns empty promise array, falls back to global registry
  - Fixed bug: Changed composioProvider.authorize(toolkitSlug, userId, { callbackUrl }) to composioProvider.authorize(toolkitSlug, userId, callbackUrl)
  - Verified build passes (124/124 tasks successful)

## Next Engineer Notes:
- Task 033 completed successfully - Tool selector UI component is now in place
- This component allows users to review and deselect individual tools from the selected toolkits
- The component provides fine-grained control over which tools to include in the integration
- All tools are selected by default, and users can deselect specific tools they don't need
- Next logical high-priority tasks are the remaining UI components:
  - Task 034 (P0): Copy MCP connection input component - HIGHEST PRIORITY
  - Task 035 (P0): Copy Smithery browser component
  - Task 036 (P0): Copy add tools dialog (main wizard that combines all components)
  - Consider completing Task 034 next to continue building the integration UI flow
