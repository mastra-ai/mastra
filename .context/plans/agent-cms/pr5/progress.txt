- Added checkPermission() helper for RBAC permission checking (requires 'audit:read')
- Added convertToCSV() helper for CSV export formatting
- All handlers include proper error handling with HTTPException (401, 403, 404, 503)
- Handlers use getAuthProvider() and getAuditStorage() helpers (stubbed for later integration)
- Route signatures follow server adapter pattern with queryParamSchema, pathParamSchema
- CSV export includes headers and properly escaped fields
- Verified full monorepo typecheck passes
- Verified full monorepo build passes (123 tasks successful)
- All audit API endpoints are ready for route registration (Task 020)

Important notes for next engineer:
- Audit handlers are implemented but getAuthProvider() and getAuditStorage() currently return null
- Once auth provider and audit storage are integrated into Mastra config, update these helpers
- Request object access needed for proper getCurrentUser and permission checking
- The handlers work with AuditStorage from @mastra/core/storage
- Permission checking is stubbed with TODOs for when Request object is available
- CSV export returns data object with contentType and filename for server adapter handling
- All schemas properly coerce dates and numbers for URL query parameters

Next engineer: Task 020 (Register auth and audit routes) is ready to implement. This will wire up the auth handlers (Task 018) and audit handlers (Task 019) to the server router, making all auth and audit endpoints accessible.

### 2026-01-17 - Task 020 Complete
- Created packages/server/src/server/server-adapter/routes/auth.ts with auth route exports
- Exported all 7 auth routes: capabilities, current user, SSO login, SSO callback, logout, credentials sign-in, credentials sign-up
- Created packages/server/src/server/server-adapter/routes/audit.ts with audit route exports
- Exported all 3 audit routes: list events, get event by ID, export events
- Updated packages/server/src/server/server-adapter/routes/index.ts to import and register routes
- Added AUDIT_ROUTES and AUTH_ROUTES imports
- Registered AUTH_ROUTES and AUDIT_ROUTES in SERVER_ROUTES array
- Auth routes now accessible at /api/auth/*
- Audit routes now accessible at /api/audit/*
- All routes follow the same pattern as other route files (SYSTEM_ROUTES, AGENTS_ROUTES, etc.)
- Routes include appropriate tags for OpenAPI organization
- Verified server package typecheck passes with npx tsc --noEmit
- Verified full monorepo build passes with pnpm build (123 tasks successful)
- Routes are ready for use by the server adapters (Express, Hono, etc.)

Important notes for next engineer:
- Auth and audit endpoints are now registered and will appear in the OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- The auth handlers still have getAuthProvider() stubbed - needs integration with Mastra config
- The audit handlers still have getAuditStorage() stubbed - needs integration with Mastra config
- Request object access still needed for proper getCurrentUser, session management, and permission checking
- All routes follow RESTful conventions and return appropriate status codes
- Routes are protected by middleware for authentication and permissions where appropriate

Next engineer: Task 021 (Create WorkOS auth provider package structure) or other auth provider tasks (026, 028) are ready to implement. These are all P0 backend tasks that set up the actual auth provider packages. Alternatively, continue with frontend tasks (029-039) or testing tasks (040-043).
