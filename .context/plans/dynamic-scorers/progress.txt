Task 001 - Pull PR #11785 changes and fix identified issues - COMPLETED
========================================================================
Date: 2026-01-15
Engineer: Claude

Summary:
- Reviewed PR #11785 (dynamic scorers backend) and identified key missing components
- Created resolve-stored-scorer.ts for our simplified StoredScorerType design
- Integrated storedScorers domain into the main storage system
- Added StoredScorersStorage to StorageDomains type
- Updated getStore() JSDoc to document storedScorers as a valid domain
- Verified pagination handling is correct (perPage: false properly handled)
- Verified no JSON parsing issues in in-memory implementation (uses Maps directly)
- Verified timestamps use new Date() wrapping in inmemory.ts

Note: Instead of directly merging PR #11785 (which has a different, more complex design
with multiple steps and agent-scorer assignments), we built upon our existing simpler
design (tasks 002-004) and added the missing resolve-stored-scorer utility.

Task 005 - Add API schemas for stored scorers - COMPLETED
==========================================================
Date: 2026-01-15
Engineer: Claude

Summary:
- Created comprehensive Zod validation schemas for stored scorers API
- Followed the same patterns as stored-agents.ts and agent-versions.ts for consistency
- Defined all path parameter, query parameter, body, and response schemas
- Added validation for score range (min must be less than max)
- Set proper defaults (scoreRange defaults to { min: 0, max: 1 })
- Included schemas for both scorer CRUD operations and version management

Files created:
- packages/server/src/server/schemas/stored-scorers.ts (198 lines)

Schema sections implemented:
1. Path Parameter Schemas:
   - storedScorerIdPathParams (for scorer routes)
   - scorerVersionIdPathParams (for version routes)

2. Query Parameter Schemas:
   - listStoredScorersQuerySchema (pagination, orderBy, filters)
   - listScorerVersionsQuerySchema (pagination, orderBy)

3. Body Parameter Schemas:
   - createStoredScorerBodySchema (with id, name, description, model, prompt, scoreRange)
   - updateStoredScorerBodySchema (partial update)
   - createScorerVersionBodySchema (name, changeMessage)

4. Response Schemas:
   - storedScorerSchema (full scorer object)
   - scorerVersionSchema (full version object)
   - List, get, create, update, delete response schemas
   - Version list, get, activate, restore, delete response schemas

Key validation rules:
- name: required, min 1, max 100 chars
- description: optional, max 500 chars
- prompt: required, min 1 char
- scoreRange: defaults to {min: 0, max: 1}, validated min < max
- model: required provider and name, optional toolChoice and reasoningEffort

Verification:
- pnpm typecheck: PASSED (no errors for stored-scorers)
- pnpm build: PASSED (all 121 tasks successful)

Next steps:
- Task 006: Add Mastra class methods for stored scorers
- Task 007: Create API endpoints for stored scorers CRUD
- Task 008: Implement auto-versioning on scorer update

Status: COMMITTED AND VERIFIED


Task 006 - Add Mastra class methods for stored scorers - COMPLETED
===================================================================
Date: 2026-01-15
Engineer: Claude

Summary:
- Verified that Mastra class already contains all required methods for stored scorers
- Methods were implemented in a previous session and are fully functional
- All acceptance criteria from the task are met

Methods implemented in packages/core/src/mastra/index.ts (lines 1021-1240):
1. getStoredScorerById(id: string): Promise<StoredScorerType | null>
   - Gets a single scorer using getScorerByIdResolved for version resolution
   - Includes proper error handling for storage not configured
   
2. listStoredScorers(args?): Promise<{scorers, total, page, perPage, hasMore}>
   - Lists all stored scorers with pagination support
   - Uses listScorersResolved to get version-resolved configs
   - Supports filtering by ownerId and metadata
   
3. getStoredScorersStore(): Promise<StoredScorersStorage | undefined>
   - Returns the storage instance for direct access to storage methods
   
4. resolveStoredScorer(id: string): Promise<MastraScorer | null>
   - Fetches stored scorer and converts it to executable MastraScorer
   - Uses the resolveStoredScorer utility function
   
5. getScorer(id: string): Promise<MastraScorer | null>
   - Unified method that checks code-defined scorers first
   - Falls back to stored scorers from database
   - Single interface for both sources

Features:
- Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples
- Proper error handling with MastraError
- Logger integration for exception tracking
- Version resolution through getScorerByIdResolved
- Consistent patterns with agent storage methods

Verification:
- pnpm typecheck: PASSED
- pnpm build:core: PASSED (9 tasks, 29.09s)

Next steps:
- Task 007: Create API endpoints for stored scorers CRUD
- Task 008: Implement auto-versioning on scorer update
- Task 009: Create API endpoints for scorer versions

Status: VERIFIED AND COMPLETE


Task 007 - Create API endpoints for stored scorers CRUD - COMPLETED
===================================================================
Date: 2026-01-15
Engineer: Claude

Summary:
- Created comprehensive REST API endpoints for stored scorers CRUD operations
- Followed the exact same patterns as stored-agents handlers for consistency
- Implemented all 5 CRUD endpoints with proper validation and error handling
- Registered routes in the main SERVER_ROUTES array
- All endpoints use getScorerByIdResolved for version-aware data retrieval

Files created:
- packages/server/src/server/handlers/stored-scorers.ts (242 lines)
- packages/server/src/server/server-adapter/routes/stored-scorers.ts (23 lines)

Files modified:
- packages/server/src/server/server-adapter/routes/index.ts (added STORED_SCORERS_ROUTES import and registration)

API Endpoints implemented:
1. GET /api/stored/scorers - List all stored scorers with pagination
   - Supports page, perPage, orderBy, ownerId, metadata filters
   - Returns paginated list with hasMore flag

2. GET /api/stored/scorers/:scorerId - Get single scorer by ID
   - Uses getScorerByIdResolved for version-aware retrieval
   - Returns 404 if scorer not found

3. POST /api/stored/scorers - Create new scorer
   - Validates all required fields via Zod schema
   - Checks for duplicate IDs before creation
   - Returns 409 if scorer with same ID exists

4. PATCH /api/stored/scorers/:scorerId - Update existing scorer
   - Partial update with all fields optional
   - Verifies scorer exists before update
   - Note: Auto-versioning will be added in task 008

5. DELETE /api/stored/scorers/:scorerId - Delete scorer
   - Verifies scorer exists before deletion
   - Returns success message on completion
   - Cascades to delete all versions (handled by storage layer)

Key implementation details:
- All handlers follow try/catch pattern with handleError utility
- Storage domain accessed via mastra.getStorage().getStore('storedScorers')
- Proper HTTP status codes (404, 409, 500) for different error scenarios
- Path parameter is 'scorerId' (not 'storedScorerId') per schema definition
- Storage methods called with wrapped parameters: { id: string }, { scorer: ... }

Verification:
- pnpm typecheck: PASSED
- pnpm build (server package): PASSED
- All 5 CRUD endpoints compile without errors

Next steps:
- Task 008: Implement auto-versioning on scorer update
- Task 009: Create API endpoints for scorer versions
- Task 010: Merge code-defined and stored scorers in list endpoint
