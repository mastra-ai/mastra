# Persistent conversations and thread switching

## Origin PR / commit

- PR: [#13218](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13218) — project-scoped persistent conversations and thread switching.
- Later changes: [#13245](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13245) — moved conversation runtime onto the shared core Harness primitive and session records; [#13334](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13334) — restored optional thread locking through core Harness config; [#13343](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13343) — scoped startup auto-resume to current working directory/worktree via `projectPath` metadata; [#13690](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/13690) — added Harness resource ID helpers and improved `/resource` switching; [#14428](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14428) — speeds `/threads` by caching and lazily loading message previews; [#14436](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14436) — lets observer output update thread titles through OM metadata and Harness events; [#14690](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14690) — lists threads across all resources and keeps the selector responsive; [#14691](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14691) — removes live preview lookup so the selector only uses fresh cache/title data; [#14567](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/14567) — adds `/thread` for current-thread/resource/fork provenance and exposes thread IDs for recall browsing; [#15749](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra/pull/15749) — clears per-thread ephemeral projections on thread switch/create so custom commands, tasks, plans, sandbox paths, queued state, and task progress do not leak into the next active thread.

## User-visible behavior

- What the user can do: resume, create, switch, clone, inspect the active thread, and browse conversations across resources/worktrees with cached previews and generated titles.
- Success looks like: startup resumes only threads from the current directory, `/threads` lists all resources without blocking on message preview retrieval, `/thread` shows the active ID/resource/fork provenance, then messages and metadata reload without leaking another thread’s ephemeral state, custom commands, queued actions, or task progress.
- Must preserve: history, title/resource, cache freshness by `updatedAt`, mode/model metadata, goals, project path tagging, thread lock ownership, fork provenance, and related status projections.

## Entry points / commands

- Commands / shortcuts / flags: `/new`, `/threads`, `/thread`, `/resource`, headless `--continue`, `--thread`, `--title`, `--clone-thread`, `--resource-id`.
- Automatic triggers: startup thread selection filters by `metadata.projectPath`; `thread_created`, `thread_changed`.

## TUI states

- Idle: active thread shown in status; `/threads` can open selector.
- Active / modal / error: thread lock conflicts should be mediated; switching resets thread-local projections.

## Headless / non-TUI behavior

- Supported: explicit thread flags in `headless.ts`; default is new thread per prompt.
- Not supported / unknown: no interactive selector; title/ID resolution must be deterministic.

## Streaming / loading / interrupted states

- Streaming / loading: current live thread owns active stream and pending tool/task projections.
- Abort / retry / resume: switching during active work depends on harness/thread-lock behavior.

## Streaming vs loaded-from-history behavior

- While actively streaming: TUI holds transient component maps, pending tools, and task insertion state.
- After reload / history reconstruction: messages come from storage; metadata is reloaded by startup/thread-change sync.

## State ownership

| State | Owner / source of truth | Consumers |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Thread history | Harness memory/storage | TUI history renderer, headless |
| Current thread/resource | Harness session + resource ID helpers | TUI status, `/resource`, commands |
| Thread title/metadata | Thread metadata/session records, optionally updated by OM `threadTitle` output | TUI footer, `/threads`, `/thread`, goals, GitHub badges |
| Thread preview/title display | Thread `title` first; cache-only `state.threadPreviewCache` + `attemptedThreadPreviewIds` fallback, invalidated by thread `updatedAt` | `/threads` selector rows without live preview lookup |
| Project path scope | Thread `metadata.projectPath` + legacy directory birthtime fallback | Startup auto-resume filtering |
| Ephemeral tasks/plan/sandbox | Harness state for active thread | Prompt context, TUI projection |
| Ephemeral TUI thread state | `event-dispatch.ts`, `/new`, and clone reset helpers clear `customSlashCommands`, queued/follow-up state, task progress, component caches, active plan, sandbox paths, and `taskToolInsertIndex` at thread boundaries | Thread switch/create/clone UI and active prompt context |
| Thread lock ownership | Core Harness `threadLock` + MC filesystem lock files | Thread create/switch/select and TUI lock prompt |

## Dependencies / related features

- [Interactive TUI chat](../tui/interactive-chat.md) — history render is thread-scoped.
- [Model auth, selection, and modes](../models/model-auth-and-modes.md) — model/mode reload depends on thread/session metadata.
- [Task tracking tools and TUI progress](../tools/task-tracking.md) — task state is thread-local and must reset/reload correctly.
- [Storage backend configuration](../settings/storage-backend.md) — selected backend owns persisted thread/session history.

## Missing tests

- Restart TUI after streamed messages/tools/tasks and verify reconstructed UI/status.
- Thread switch resets ephemeral tasks/plan/sandbox but reloads persisted metadata.
- Headless `--continue` / `--thread title` after Harness v1 session prefill.
- MC-level test that core thread lock conflicts reach the TUI lock prompt across real process-style locks.
- Startup auto-resume test for same-resource worktrees: strict `projectPath`, legacy birthtime fallback, and retroactive tagging.

## Known risks / regressions

- Slack reported new-session creation broken on alpha; needs current repro/verification.
- Model/mode reload bug belongs partly here because thread/session metadata is the reload path.
- Backend switching can make existing history appear missing unless storage migration is explicit.
- Harness v1 session prefill is high risk for stale/incomplete thread records.
- Worktrees share resource IDs; missing/incorrect `projectPath` metadata can resume the wrong directory’s thread.
- Removing live preview lookup keeps `/threads` fast, but stale/missing titles now matter more because uncached placeholder-title threads have no on-demand first-message fallback.

## Verification checklist

- [x] Code paths checked.
- [x] Existing tests identified.
- [x] Missing tests listed.
- [x] State ownership verified.
- [x] TUI/headless behavior considered.
- [x] Streaming versus loaded-from-history behavior considered.
