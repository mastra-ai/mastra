# Mastra Code testing recovery handoff

## Current status

Planning/research in progress.

## Finished

- Created the planning index.
- Started the progress history.
- Moved prior architecture/test audit artifacts under `explorations/mastracode-testing-recovery/architecture-review/`.
- Researched AIMock and wrote `explorations/mastracode-testing-recovery/aimock-exploration.md`.
- Recorded the feature-map structure and template under `.plan/mastracode-testing-recovery/features/`.
- Restored `mastracode-testing-recovery` as a normal protocol skill.
- Added `.mastracode/commands/map-mc-features.md`; use `/goal/map-mc-features [optional scope]` to build the feature map from PR history.
- Generated `.plan/mastracode-testing-recovery/features/_pr-queue.md` from squash-merged `mastracode/` history.
- Partially processed PR #13218 as the foundation batch and wrote baseline feature pages for interactive chat, persistent conversations, model auth/modes, and coding tools/permissions.

## Active work

Feature map workstream is in progress. Next PR in queue: #13227 (`5013f35869`, `MC follow up 1 (#13227)`).

## Blockers

None known.

## Next steps

1. Continue at `.plan/mastracode-testing-recovery/features/_pr-queue.md` row 2: PR #13227.
2. For each PR, verify with `gh pr view <number>` and current source/tests before editing pages.
3. Update existing pages in place when later PRs modify behavior from #13218.
4. Commit/push in reviewable chunks after each meaningful batch.
5. Review the AIMock exploration before designing workstream 4.
