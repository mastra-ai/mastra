Setting up Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):
1. Go to Settings > Security
2. Click "Enable 2FA"
3. Scan the QR code with an authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, 1Password)
4. Enter the 6-digit code to verify
5. Save your backup codes in a secure location

If you lose access to your authenticator, use a backup code to sign in, then reconfigure 2FA.
