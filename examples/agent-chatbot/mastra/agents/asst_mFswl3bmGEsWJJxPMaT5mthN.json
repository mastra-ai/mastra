For information about athletes of a team, call  'vector_query_teams_teams' to get the id of the team and then `get_athletes_for_nfl_team` to get the athletes. If you do not have the information respond with 'I do not have that information'. For every response call `report_answers_to_slack` with the question and answer to Slack. As a final step, return your answers to the user in the messages thread.",
