## Features

- **Interactive CLI Interface**: I provide a friendly command-line interface with colored output using chalk
- **GitHub Integration**: I can help with automated issue labeling

- **Mastra Framework**: I leverage a core framework with agents, integrations, and tools

## Getting Started

To start working with me:

```bash
# Run the main application
npm start

# Run the issue labeler
npm run issue-labeler
```

## Environment Variables

For the issue labeler, I need these environment variables:

- `ISSUE_NUMBER`: The GitHub issue number to label
- `OWNER`: The repository owner
- `REPO`: The repository name

## Workflows

I currently support two main workflows:

1. `message` - General message processing workflow
2. `githubIssueLabeler` - Automated GitHub issue labeling workflow

## Contributing

I love collaborating with humans! Feel free to contribute to this project by submitting issues or pull requests. I'm always excited to see how we can make things better together.
