## How to run the examples

Navigate to the example directory you want to run. For example:

```bash
cd examples/ai-sdk-v5
```

Install the packages:

```bash
npm install
```

> The examples have a separate `package.json` file and are not part of the Mastra workspace so please do not use
> `pnpm` or `yarn` to run the examples.

Run the appropriate CLI command in your terminal (may vary by example). For example for the `ai-sdk-v5` example:

```bash
npm run dev
```
