 * The Knowledge page: a live force-directed graph of the project's knowledge —
 * nodes as nodes, wikilink relationships as edges. The default view is
 * project scope (org + project records, the knowledge records that carry across
 * sessions); thread-scoped knowledge is reached only by drilling into a
 * knowledge record's "captured in session" link, which switches to the thread view with
 * an org → project → thread breadcrumb (Amendment A2). Thread state lives in
 * the `?thread=` search param so the view is linkable and back-button safe.
