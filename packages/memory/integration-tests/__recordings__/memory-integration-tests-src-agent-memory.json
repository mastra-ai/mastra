              "content": "Cats, scientifically known as Felis catus, are small, domesticated mammals that belong to the family Felidae. They are one of the most popular pets worldwide, known for their companionship, playful behavior, and independent nature. Here are some key points about cats:\n\n### Physical Characteristics\n- **Size and Weight**: Domestic cats typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, with an average length of about 9 to 10 inches at the shoulder and a body length of 18 inches, not including the tail.\n- **Fur and Color**: Cats come in a variety of colors and patterns, including solid, tabby, calico, and more. Their fur can be short, medium, or long, depending on the breed.\n- **Eyes**: Cats have excellent night vision and can see in low light. Their eyes come in various colors, including green, blue, yellow, and amber.\n\n### Behavior\n- **Social Structure**: While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They communicate through vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses), body language, and scent marking.\n- **Playfulness**: Cats are playful creatures, often engaging in activities that mimic hunting behavior, such as stalking and pouncing on toys.\n- **Grooming**: Cats are known for their grooming habits, spending a significant amount of time cleaning themselves to maintain their fur and skin health.\n\n### Diet\n- **Carnivorous**: Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of meat. They have specific nutritional needs, including taurine, which is found in animal tissues.\n- **Feeding**: Commercial cat food is available in dry, wet, and raw forms, and it's important to provide a balanced diet to ensure their health.\n\n### Health\n- **Lifespan**: The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their late teens or even early twenties with proper care.\n- **Common Health Issues**: Cats can be prone to various health issues, including dental disease, obesity, kidney disease, and diabetes. Regular veterinary check-ups are essential for maintaining their health.\n\n### Breeds\nThere are numerous cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Some popular breeds include:\n- **Siamese**: Known for their striking blue eyes and vocal nature.\n- **Persian**: Recognized for their long fur and flat faces.\n- **Maine Coon**: One of the largest domesticated breeds, known for their friendly disposition.\n- **Bengal**: Known for their wild appearance and energetic personality.\n\n### Cultural Significance\nCats have been revered in various cultures throughout history. In ancient Egypt, they were considered sacred and were often associated with the goddess Bastet. Today, cats are celebrated in literature, art, and internet culture, often depicted as symbols of independence and mystery.\n\n### Conclusion\nCats are fascinating creatures that have captured the hearts of many people around the world. Their unique personalities, playful behavior, and companionship make them beloved pets in countless households. Whether you are a cat owner or simply an admirer, there is much to appreciate about these remarkable animals.",

If information might be referenced again - store it!\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Store anything that could be useful later in the conversation\n2. Update proactively when information changes, no matter how small\n3. Use Markdown format for all data\n4. Act naturally - don't mention this system to users. Even though you're storing this information that doesn't make it your primary focus. Do not ask them generally for \"information about yourself\"\n5. IMPORTANT: When calling updateWorkingMemory, the only valid parameter is the memory field. DO NOT pass an object.\n6. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS pass the data you want to store in the memory field as a string. DO NOT pass an object.\n7. IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."

It was established in the 3rd century BCE and aimed to collect all the knowledge of the world. Scholars from various cultures and backgrounds came to study there, contributing to advancements in various fields such as mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.\n\nThe library is often associated with the figure of Euclid, the mathematician known for his work in geometry, and other notable scholars like Archimedes and Eratosthenes. Unfortunately, the library suffered several incidents of destruction over the centuries, leading to the loss of many invaluable texts and scrolls.\n\nThe legacy of the Library of Alexandria continues to inspire modern libraries and institutions of learning, symbolizing the pursuit of knowledge and the importance of preserving cultural heritage.",

Here are some key points about them:\n\n### 1. **Domestication**\n- Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were attracted to human settlements due to the presence of rodents, which they hunted.\n\n### 2. **Breeds**\n- There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Popular breeds include the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n### 3. **Behavior**\n- Cats are known for their curious and playful nature. They often engage in hunting behaviors, such as stalking and pouncing, even in play.\n- They communicate through vocalizations (meows, purrs, hisses), body language, and scent marking.\n\n### 4. **Physical Characteristics**\n- Cats have sharp retractable claws, keen senses (especially hearing and sight), and a flexible body that allows for agile movements.\n- They typically weigh between 5 to 20 pounds, depending on the breed.\n\n### 5. **Diet**\n- Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily composed of meat. They need specific nutrients like taurine, which is found in animal tissues.\n\n### 6. **Lifespan**\n- The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n### 7. **Health**\n- Common health issues in cats include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease. Regular veterinary check-ups are important for maintaining their health.\n\n### 8. **Social Structure**\n- While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They may also establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n### 9. **Cultural Significance**\n- Cats have been revered in various cultures, from ancient Egypt, where they were considered sacred, to modern internet culture, where they are often featured in memes and videos.\n\n### 10. **Care**\n- Cats require regular feeding, fresh water, litter box maintenance, and mental stimulation through play and interaction.\n\nCats make wonderful companions and are cherished by millions of people around the world for their unique personalities and affectionate nature."

                "text": "We discussed several key points about cats, including:\n\n1. **Domestication**: Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago, primarily to control rodent populations near human settlements.\n\n2. **Breeds**: There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique traits, such as the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n3. **Behavior**: Cats are curious and playful, often displaying hunting behaviors even during play. They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Cats have retractable claws, keen senses, and a flexible body, typically weighing between 5 to 20 pounds.\n\n5. **Diet**: As obligate carnivores, cats require a meat-based diet and specific nutrients like taurine.\n\n6. **Lifespan**: The average lifespan is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n7. **Health**: Common health issues include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease, making regular veterinary check-ups important.\n\n8. **Social Structure**: Cats can form strong bonds with humans and other pets, and may establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n9. **Cultural Significance**: Cats have been revered in various cultures, from ancient Egypt to modern internet culture.\n\n10. **Care**: They require regular feeding, fresh water, litter box maintenance, and mental stimulation.\n\nCats are cherished companions known for their unique personalities and affectionate nature."

IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."

Scholars from different regions came to study there, making it a hub of intellectual activity.\n\nUnfortunately, the library faced several incidents of destruction over the centuries, leading to the loss of many invaluable texts. Its legacy, however, continues to inspire the pursuit of knowledge and the preservation of cultural heritage.

Here are some key points about them:\n\n### 1. **Domestication**\n- Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago in the Near East. They were attracted to human settlements due to the presence of rodents, which they hunted.\n\n### 2. **Breeds**\n- There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique characteristics. Popular breeds include the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n### 3. **Behavior**\n- Cats are known for their independent nature. They can be affectionate but often enjoy their alone time. They communicate through vocalizations (like meowing), body language, and scent marking.\n\n### 4. **Physical Characteristics**\n- Cats typically have sharp retractable claws, keen senses (especially sight and hearing), and a flexible body. They are known for their agility and ability to jump several times their height.\n\n### 5. **Diet**\n- Cats are obligate carnivores, meaning they require a diet primarily made up of meat. They have specific nutritional needs, including taurine, which is found in animal tissues.\n\n### 6. **Lifespan**\n- The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, but many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n### 7. **Health**\n- Common health issues in cats include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease. Regular veterinary check-ups and vaccinations are important for their health.\n\n### 8. **Cultural Significance**\n- Cats have been revered in various cultures. In ancient Egypt, they were considered sacred and were often depicted in art and mythology.\n\n### 9. **Social Structure**\n- While cats are often seen as solitary animals, they can form strong bonds with humans and other pets. They may also establish social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n### 10. **Play and Enrichment**\n- Cats are playful and require mental and physical stimulation. Toys, scratching posts, and interactive playtime are essential for their well-being.\n\nCats are beloved for their unique personalities and companionship, making them one of the most popular pets worldwide."

                "text": "We discussed several key points about cats, including:\n\n1. **Domestication**: Cats were domesticated around 9,000 years ago, primarily to control rodent populations near human settlements.\n\n2. **Breeds**: There are over 70 recognized cat breeds, each with unique traits, such as the Persian, Maine Coon, Siamese, and Bengal.\n\n3. **Behavior**: Cats are independent creatures that can be affectionate but also enjoy solitude. They communicate through vocalizations, body language, and scent marking.\n\n4. **Physical Characteristics**: Cats have sharp retractable claws, keen senses, and a flexible body, making them agile hunters.\n\n5. **Diet**: As obligate carnivores, cats require a meat-based diet and have specific nutritional needs, including taurine.\n\n6. **Lifespan**: The average lifespan of a domestic cat is around 12 to 15 years, though many can live into their 20s with proper care.\n\n7. **Health**: Common health issues include dental disease, obesity, and kidney disease, highlighting the importance of regular veterinary care.\n\n8. **Cultural Significance**: Cats have been revered in various cultures, notably in ancient Egypt, where they were considered sacred.\n\n9. **Social Structure**: While often seen as solitary, cats can form strong bonds with humans and other pets, establishing social hierarchies in multi-cat households.\n\n10. **Play and Enrichment**: Cats require mental and physical stimulation through play, toys, and interactive activities for their well-being.\n\nOverall, cats are cherished for their unique personalities and companionship."

If information might be referenced again - store it!\n\nGuidelines:\n1. Store anything that could be useful later in the conversation\n2. Update proactively when information changes, no matter how small\n3. Use Markdown format for all data\n4. Act naturally - don't mention this system to users. Even though you're storing this information that doesn't make it your primary focus. Do not ask them generally for \"information about yourself\"\n5. IMPORTANT: When calling updateWorkingMemory, the only valid parameter is the memory field. DO NOT pass an object.\n6. IMPORTANT: ALWAYS pass the data you want to store in the memory field as a string. DO NOT pass an object.\n7. IMPORTANT: Data must only be sent as a string no matter which format is used.\n\n\n<working_memory_template>\n# User Information\n- **First Name**: \n- **Last Name**: \n- **Location**: \n- **Occupation**: \n- **Interests**: \n- **Goals**: \n- **Events**: \n- **Facts**: \n- **Projects**:\n</working_memory_template>\n\n\n\n\n<working_memory_data>\n# User Information\nName: John Doe\nFavorite color: Blue\n</working_memory_data>\n\nNotes:\n- Update memory whenever referenced information changes\n- If you're unsure whether to store something, store it (eg if the user tells you information about themselves, call updateWorkingMemory immediately to update it)\n- This system is here so that you can maintain the conversation when your context window is very short. Update your working memory because you may need it to maintain the conversation without the full conversation history\n- Do not remove empty sections - you must include the empty sections along with the ones you're filling in\n- REMEMBER: the way you update your working memory is by calling the updateWorkingMemory tool with the entire Markdown content. The system will store it for you. The user will not see it.\n- IMPORTANT: You MUST call updateWorkingMemory in every response to a prompt where you received relevant information.\n- IMPORTANT: Preserve the Markdown formatting structure above while updating the content."
