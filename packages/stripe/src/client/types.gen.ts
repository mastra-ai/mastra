 * events. For example, if you create a new subscription for a
 * customer, you receive both a `customer.subscription.created` event and a
 * `charge.succeeded` event.
 *
 * Events occur when the state of another API resource changes. The event's data

 * example, a `charge.succeeded` event contains a charge, and an

 *
 * Please refer to our [Exchange Rates API](https://stripe.com/docs/fx-rates) guide for more details.

 * current. To do so, you must pass in the exchange_rate to charges endpoints. If the

 * - *determine app fees to charge a connected account*

 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
 * Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
 * that finalizing the invoice,
 * [when automatic](https://stripe.com/docs/invoicing/integration/automatic-advancement-collection), does

 * until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
 * webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
 * connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
 * creation to finalize the invoice.
 *
 * If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
 * [email settings](https://dashboard.stripe.com/account/billing/automatic),
 * Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
 * emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
 *
 * Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
 * amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
 * charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe's [minimum allowed charge
 * per currency](/docs/currencies#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
 * invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
 * customer's credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.

 * PaymentMethodConfigurations control which payment methods are displayed to your customers when you don't explicitly specify payment method types. You can have multiple configurations with different sets of payment methods for different scenarios.

 *
 * **Direct** configurations apply to payments created on your account, including Connect destination charges, Connect separate charges and transfers, and payments not involving Connect.
 *
 * **Child** configurations apply to payments created on your connected accounts using direct charges, and charges with the on_behalf_of parameter.
 *
 * Child configurations have a `parent` that sets default values and controls which settings connected accounts may override. You can specify a parent ID at payment time, and Stripe will automatically resolve the connected account’s associated child configuration. Parent configurations are [managed in the dashboard](https://dashboard.stripe.com/settings/payment_methods/connected_accounts) and are not available in this API.

/**
 * A SetupIntent guides you through the process of setting up and saving a customer's payment credentials for future payments.
 * For example, you can use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer's card without immediately collecting a payment.
 * Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
 *
 * Create a SetupIntent when you're ready to collect your customer's payment credentials.
 * Don't maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents because they might not be valid.
 * The SetupIntent transitions through multiple [statuses](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/intents#intent-statuses) as it guides
 * you through the setup process.
 *
 * Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
 * For example, cardholders in [certain regions](https://stripe.com/guides/strong-customer-authentication) might need to be run through
 * [Strong Customer Authentication](https://docs.stripe.com/strong-customer-authentication) during payment method collection
 * to streamline later [off-session payments](https://docs.stripe.com/payments/setup-intents).
 * If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https://stripe.com/docs/api#setup_intent_object-customer),
 * it automatically attaches the resulting payment method to that Customer after successful setup.
 * We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https://stripe.com/docs/api#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
 * PaymentIntents to save payment methods to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
 *
 * By using SetupIntents, you can reduce friction for your customers, even as regulations change over time.

See the [SCA Migration Guide](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication) for Billing to learn more. This is the default behavior.

         * Use `default_incomplete` to create Subscriptions with `status=incomplete` when the first invoice requires payment, otherwise start as active. Subscriptions transition to `status=active` when successfully confirming the PaymentIntent on the first invoice. This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional customer actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice, such as failed payments, [SCA regulation](https://stripe.com/docs/billing/migration/strong-customer-authentication), or collecting a mandate for a bank debit payment method. If the PaymentIntent is not confirmed within 23 hours Subscriptions transition to `status=incomplete_expired`, which is a terminal state.

         * Use `error_if_incomplete` if you want Stripe to return an HTTP 402 status code if a subscription's first invoice can't be paid. For example, if a payment method requires 3DS authentication due to SCA regulation and further customer action is needed, this parameter doesn't create a Subscription and returns an error instead.

This allows simpler management of scenarios where additional user actions are needed to pay a subscription’s invoice.
