/**
 * Harness v1 — runtime Session class.
 *
 * This is the in-memory authority for a single SessionRecord (§5.4). The
 * Harness creates one instance per live session and routes all writes to
 * the underlying record through it. The full surface is described in §4.2;
 * the M1 slice ships only identity + lifecycle. Everything else still throws
 * `Not implemented`.
 *
 * Lifecycle states tracked here:
 *   - 'live'    — session is in the harness's live map and holds the lease.
 *   - 'closed'  — `close()` has run; record has `closedAt` set in storage.
 *   - 'evicted' — flushed to storage and dropped from live map; the record
 *                 remains active and the session can be re-hydrated. Currently
 *                 unused; lands with §5.4 idle eviction.
 *
 * Once a Session leaves 'live', every method except identity reads throws.
 * Callers must re-resolve via `harness.session(...)` to get a fresh instance.
