Here's the structured changelog for the core package updates between 2025-02-02 and 2025-02-09:

### Breaking Changes

- Renamed `MastraLibSQLStorage` and `MastraLibSQLVector` to `DefaultStorage` and `DefaultVectorDB` respectively for better clarity (legacy names still exported for backwards compatibility) (#5285356)
- Memory API now requires an embedder instance instead of embeddings config object (#d7d465a)
- Moved `@mastra/vector-libsql` functionality into `@mastra/core/vector/libsql` (#16e5b04)

### New Features

- Added new short-term "working" memory for agents with `maskStreamTags` helper to hide working memory blocks in streams (#27275c9)
- Added new LLM primitive architecture with support for OpenAI, AmazonBedrock, and Anthropic (#6fa4bd2, #e2e76de)
- Added filter translators for Chroma and Qdrant vector stores (#7f24c29, #2f17a5f)

### Improvements

- Memory API improvements:
  - Renamed `historySearch` to `semanticRecall` for clarity
  - Renamed `embeddingOptions` to `embedding` (#e9d1b47)
  - Added ability to pass configured Memory instances directly to Agent (#b4d416)
  - Added fallback title generation for threads (#2017553)
  - Added helpful error message for vector usage (#3700be1)

### Notable Bug Fixes

- Fixed storage bugs related to the new Memory API (#67637ba)
- Updated operator validation and handling for all vector stores (#ccbc581)
- Added `__registerPrimitives` to model.ts for proper initialization (#8151f44)

### Build/Deployment

- Updated deployer logic and configuration (#4d4f6b6, #38b7f66)
- Added `sideEffects: false` flag for better tree-shaking
- Streamlined dependencies by moving several packages to peer dependencies

This release focuses on improving the developer experience through better naming conventions, enhanced memory capabilities, and more robust vector store support. The changes to the Memory API represent a significant improvement in usability while maintaining backwards compatibility.
