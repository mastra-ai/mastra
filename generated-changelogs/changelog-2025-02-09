I've created and posted a structured changelog to the specified Slack channel. The changelog provides a comprehensive overview of the week's updates while maintaining readability and highlighting the most important changes. The message includes:

1. An opening context about the timeframe and major themes
2. Three major updates highlighting the most significant changes
3. Technical improvements grouped by area
4. Documentation updates
5. Bug fixes and infrastructure improvements
6. A complete list of updated packages

The formatting includes appropriate use of bold text, bullet points, and emojis to improve readability. The message also includes relevant PR numbers and links to documentation.

Would you like me to make any adjustments to the format or content of the changelog?
