- Added type safety for filter operations (#c87eb4e)
- Improved error handling for invalid queries and connection issues (#c87eb4e)

## Notable Bug Fixes

- Fixed handling of null values and empty arrays in filters (#c87eb4e)
- Corrected dimension validation for vector inputs (#c87eb4e)

## Build/Deployment

- Updated package structure with separate vector and filter modules (#c87eb4e)
- Added comprehensive test suite with 100+ test cases (#c87eb4e)
- Configured tsup for optimized builds (#b422ed3)

## Documentation

- Added detailed API documentation with examples (#c87eb4e)
- Included migration guide from `@mastra/vector-qdrant` (#c87eb4e)
- Added code examples for all filtering operations (#c87eb4e)

This release represents a significant evolution of the Qdrant integration, with major improvements to filtering capabilities and overall reliability. The new filter translation system enables complex queries while maintaining type safety and performance.

## stores/upstash

Here's the changelog for the Upstash module updates from February 2-9, 2025:

## @mastra/upstash Updates

  - Pattern matching with glob syntax
  - Nested field queries
  - Logical operators (AND, OR, NOT, NOR)
  - Field existence checks

### Improvements

- Reorganized source code into dedicated `src/vector` and `src/storage` directories for better maintainability (#c87eb4e)
- Enhanced filter translation system with comprehensive operator support
- Added proper test skipping when Upstash credentials are unavailable
- Improved error handling for invalid filter conditions and edge cases

### Notable Bug Fixes

- Fixed handling of special characters in filter strings
- Corrected scientific notation number formatting in queries
- Addressed issues with empty array conditions in filters

### Build/Deployment

- Added Docker compose configuration for local development
- Updated package exports to include both vector and storage functionality
- Added comprehensive test coverage for filter operations

### Migration Guide

Users should:

1. Replace `@mastra/vector-upstash` and `@mastra/store-upstash` with `@mastra/upstash`
2. Update imports:

   ```typescript
   // Old
   import { UpstashVector } from '@mastra/vector-upstash'
   import { UpstashStore } from '@mastra/store-upstash'

   // New
   import { UpstashVector, UpstashStore } from '@mastra/upstash'
   ```

This release represents a major consolidation of Upstash functionality while maintaining backward compatibility.
