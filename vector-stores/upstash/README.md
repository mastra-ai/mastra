# @mastra/vector-upstash

⚠️ **DEPRECATED** ⚠️

This package has been merged into `@mastra/upstash`. Please use the new package instead:

```bash
npm install @mastra/upstash
```

Then update your imports:

```typescript
// Old import
import { UpstashVector } from '@mastra/vector-upstash';

// New import
import { UpstashVector } from '@mastra/upstash';
```

The new package combines both vector store and storage functionality in one place. See the documentation at `@mastra/upstash` for more details.
