Added a memory-settings storage domain: observational memory settings (observer and reflector models, thresholds, attachment observation) changed in the web app are now stored in the app database — one row per user — instead of settings.json, and the settings page reads them back from the database. Factory-mounted agent controllers no longer seed observational memory settings from the host machine's settings.json (new `disableSettingsOmSeed` SDK option), so server sessions start from built-in defaults plus whatever is stored in the database. The OM settings model pickers in the web UI are now searchable comboboxes.
