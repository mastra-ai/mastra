'mastra': patch
---

Improved AGENTS.md generated by create-mastra to emphasize loading the Mastra skill before working with Mastra code. When skills are configured, the file now includes a CRITICAL section at the top and detailed loading instructions to ensure agents use current APIs instead of outdated training data.
