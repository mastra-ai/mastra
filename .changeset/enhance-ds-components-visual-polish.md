Enhance design system components with visual polish and micro-interactions.

Phase 2 of DS enhancement covering 40+ components:

- **Form Controls**: Checkbox, RadioGroup, Switch, Slider, Combobox with focus rings, hover states, and smooth transitions
- **Navigation**: Tabs with animated indicator, Steps with progress animation, Collapsible with icon rotation
- **Feedback**: Alert with entrance animation, Notification with slide animations, Skeleton with gradient shimmer
- **Display**: Badge with semantic variants, Avatar with interactive mode, StatusBadge enhancements
- **Layout**: SideDialog with backdrop blur, ScrollArea with visibility transitions

All components now use consistent design tokens (duration-normal, ease-out-custom, shadow-focus-ring) and GPU-accelerated properties for smooth 60fps animations.
