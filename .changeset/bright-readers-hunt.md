Added structured output support for Claude and OpenAI SDK agents using their provider-native structured output APIs. Cursor SDK agent calls now fail clearly when structuredOutput is requested because the Cursor TypeScript SDK does not expose a schema-constrained output API. SDK agents now implement provider-native resume through Mastra's existing resumeGenerate/resumeStream methods by accepting provider-specific resumeData with a message payload.
