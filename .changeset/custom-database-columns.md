Add support for custom user-defined columns in Mastra database tables. Developers can now enrich the default storage schema with their own fields without spinning up a separate database or writing a custom storage adapter. This makes Mastra's Memory layer more flexible for real-world multi-tenant and domain-specific use cases.
