Added Claude Code skills for React and Tailwind best practices. The react-best-practices skill provides 12 performance optimization rules across 6 categories (waterfall elimination, bundle size, data fetching, re-renders, rendering, JS performance). The tailwind-best-practices skill enforces design system consistency in playground packages with rules for component usage, design tokens, and className patterns. Simplified CLAUDE.md files in playground packages to reference these centralized skills.
