Added generic Harness class to @mastra/core for orchestrating agents with modes, state management, built-in tools (ask_user, submit_plan), subagent support, Observational Memory integration, model discovery, and permission-aware tool approval. The Harness provides a reusable foundation for building agent-powered applications with features like thread management, heartbeat monitoring, and event-driven architecture.
