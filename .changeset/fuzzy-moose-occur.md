Added markdown language support to CodeEditor with syntax highlighting for headings, emphasis, links, and code blocks. New `language` prop accepts 'json' (default) or 'markdown'. Added variable highlighting extension that visually distinguishes `{{variableName}}` patterns with orange styling when `highlightVariables` prop is enabled.
