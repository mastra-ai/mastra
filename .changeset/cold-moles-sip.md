**New feature:** You can install the Mastra skill during the `create-mastra` wizard.

The wizard now asks you to install the official Mastra skill. Choose your favorite agent and your newly created project is set up.
For non-interactive setup, use the `--skills` flag that accepts comma-separated agent names (e.g. `--skills claude-code`).
