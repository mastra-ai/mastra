'@mastra/playground-ui': patch
---

Added a dedicated Integration Tools section to the agent CMS tools page. Providers are shown as cards — clicking one opens a side dialog with toolkit navigation on the left and a searchable, multi-select tool list on the right. Selected tools persist to the agent form. Regular tools now appear in a separate "Available Tools" section.
