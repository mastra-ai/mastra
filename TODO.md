# Message Format Unification - Cleanup TODO

## 🔍 INVESTIGATION COMPLETE - Summary of Findings

### ❌ ALL Changes Below ARE From Our Branch (Need Review)

**IMPORTANT**: The `git diff origin/main...HEAD` shows these as OUR changes, meaning they will appear in the PR diff.

1. **RuntimeContext removal** (line 59 in memory.ts)
   - Changed: `runtimeContext: runtimeContext ?? new RuntimeContext()` → `runtimeContext`
   - **Status**: This change exists in our branch commits (096b9571ee "save" and earlier)
   - **Verdict**: Need to investigate WHY we made this change ❌

2. **Working memory scope** (line 438 in memory.ts)
   - Changed: `scope !== 'thread'` → `scope === 'resource'`
   - **Status**: This change exists in our branch commits
   - **Verdict**: Need to investigate WHY we made this change ❌

3. **React `ai-v5` dependency**
   - We added this, creates version mismatch with `@ai-sdk/react` ❌

4. **MCP SDK ts-ignore**
   - We added this workaround for tsup issue ❌

5. **Streaming docs simplification**
   - Simplification is correct (`toAISdkStream` has default `{ from: 'agent' }`) ✅ BUT wrong directory ❌

6. **`message-format.ts`**
   - New file we added, only used in `convert-messages.ts` ❓

---

## 🔴 CRITICAL: Documentation Directory Issue ✅ COMPLETE
**We updated `docs/` instead of `docs-new/`!**

- [x] **Revert all changes to `docs/src/content/en/`** - these are the old docs ✅
- [x] **Apply equivalent changes to `docs-new/docs/`** - N/A (docs-new removed in main) ✅
- [x] Files that need to be moved from `docs/` to `docs-new/`:
  - `docs/src/content/en/reference/client-js/agents.mdx` → `docs-new/docs/reference/client-js/agents.md`
  - `docs/src/content/en/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk.mdx` → `docs-new/docs/frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk.md`
  - `docs/src/content/en/examples/agents/ai-sdk-v5-integration.mdx` → `docs-new/docs/examples/agents/ai-sdk-v5-integration.md`

---

## 🟡 HIGH PRIORITY: Unrelated/Incorrect Changes

### 1. React Package Dependencies
**Issue:** Added `ai-v5` to `@mastra/react` package.json, changed import from `@ai-sdk/react` to `ai-v5`

**Files:**
- `client-sdks/react/package.json`
- `client-sdks/react/src/lib/ai-sdk/types.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
- [x] Reverted `ai-v5` dependency from `client-sdks/react/package.json`
- [x] Changed `client-sdks/react/src/lib/ai-sdk/types.ts` back to importing from `@ai-sdk/react`

**Reason:** Version mismatch - `hooks.ts` uses `@ai-sdk/react` (v2), but `types.ts` was importing from `ai-v5` (v5)

---

### 2. React Test File Changes
**Issue:** Massive diffs in test files that seem unrelated to our PR

**Files:**
- `client-sdks/react/src/lib/ai-sdk/transformers/AISdkNetworkTransformer.test.ts`
- `client-sdks/react/src/lib/ai-sdk/utils/toUIMessage.test.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **REVIEWED - KEEP**
- [x] Reviewed test changes
- [x] Verified they're related to our message format work

**Reason:** Changes are legitimate - using `ChunkFrom.NETWORK` and adding missing fields to match updated types

---

### 3. MCP SDK Import Workaround
**Issue:** Added `@ts-ignore` comments for MCP SDK imports with direct `dist/esm` paths

**File:** `packages/core/src/tools/types.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**
- [x] Reverted `packages/core/src/tools/types.ts` to `origin/main` version
- [x] Verified build still works with original imports

**Reason:** Original imports work correctly; the `@ts-ignore` workaround was unnecessary

---

### 4. Server Memory Handler Changes
**Issue:** Several changes that seem unrelated to message format unification

**Files:**
- `packages/server/src/server/handlers/memory.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **REVIEWED - KEEP**
- [x] Verified actual changes in git diff
- [x] Confirmed all changes are correct and related to our work

**Actual Changes:**
1. Import: `convertMessages` → `MastraDBMessage` type
2. `getMessagesHandler`: Returns `memory.query()` result directly (which is `{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }`)
3. `searchMemoryHandler`: Uses `result` instead of `result.messagesV2` and `.messages` instead of `.uiMessages`

**Note:** The `runtimeContext` and `workingMemory?.scope` issues mentioned in the TODO were based on outdated merge conflict information and don't actually exist in the current diff.

---

---

### 6. Documentation Content Issues

**Status:** ✅ **RESOLVED**
- [x] Documentation changes were in `docs/src/content/en/` (old structure)
- [x] Reverted all changes to old documentation structure
- [x] `docs-new` was removed in `main` - no action needed

**Note:** The documentation structure changed in `main`. Our original updates to `docs-new/` were correct but became obsolete when `main` removed that directory.

---

## 🟢 MEDIUM PRIORITY: API Cleanup & Consistency

### 7. Remove Deprecated Type Alias ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** We have a deprecated `MastraMessageV2` alias that should be removed in a breaking change

**File:** `packages/core/src/agent/message-list/index.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE** (completed earlier in the project)
- [x] Removed the `MastraMessageV2` type alias entirely
- [x] We're already doing a breaking change, no need to keep deprecated aliases
- [x] Searched codebase for any remaining `MastraMessageV2` usage and replaced with `MastraDBMessage`

---

### 8. Remove Unnecessary Comment
**File:** `packages/core/src/agent/message-list/index.ts` (line 96)

**Current:**
```typescript
| MastraDBMessage // <- this is how we currently store in the DB
```

**Action:**
- [ ] Remove the comment - it's now obvious since the type is named `MastraDBMessage`

---

### 9. Standardize Return Types
**Issue:** Inconsistent return types across memory methods

**Current State:**
- Some methods return `Promise<MastraDBMessage[]>`
- Others return `Promise<{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }>`

**Files to check:**
- `packages/core/src/memory/memory.ts`
- `packages/memory/src/index.ts`
- All storage adapter implementations

**Action:**
- [ ] Decide on standard: **Recommend `{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }` for consistency**
- [ ] Update these methods to use object wrapper:
  - [ ] `rememberMessages()` - currently returns `Promise<MastraDBMessage[]>`
  - [ ] `saveMessages()` - check current return type
  - [ ] `getMessagesById()` - check current return type
  - [ ] Any other message retrieval methods
- [ ] Update all storage adapter implementations
- [ ] Update all tests
- [ ] Update documentation

**Rationale:** Object wrapper allows for future extensibility (e.g., adding pagination metadata, counts, etc.)

---

### 10. Remove Format Parameter from Get Methods
**Issue:** Methods still have `format` parameter but should only return `MastraDBMessage` now

**Files:**
- `packages/core/src/memory/memory.ts`
- `packages/memory/src/index.ts`

**Methods to update:**
- [ ] `getMessages()` - remove format parameter, always return `MastraDBMessage[]`
- [ ] `saveMessages()` - keep format for V1 input support, but output should be consistent
- [ ] `getMessagesById()` - remove format parameter
- [ ] Review all other methods with format parameters

**Note:** V1 is input-only now, not an output format

---

### 11. Rename `.v2()` Methods to `.db()` or `.mastraDb()` ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** MessageList get methods use `.v2()` suffix which is confusing now

**File:** `packages/core/src/agent/message-list/index.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Decided on naming: `.db()` (shorter and clearer)
- [x] Renamed all `.v2()` methods to `.db()` in:
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/index.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/tests/message-list.test.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/utils/convert-messages.ts
  - packages/core/src/storage/domains/memory/inmemory.ts
  - packages/core/src/processors/processors/structured-output.test.ts
  - packages/core/src/processors/runner.ts
  - packages/core/src/loop/network/index.ts
  - packages/core/src/stream/base/output.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/agent.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/workflows/prepare-stream/prepare-memory-step.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/__tests__/stream.test.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/tests/message-list-aisdk-v5-url.test.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/tests/message-list-url-handling.test.ts
  - packages/core/src/agent/message-list/tests/message-list-v5.test.ts
  - packages/memory/integration-tests/src/processors.test.ts
  - packages/memory/integration-tests/src/test-utils.ts
  - packages/memory/integration-tests/src/reusable-tests.ts
  - packages/memory/integration-tests-v5/src/processors.test.ts
  - packages/memory/integration-tests-v5/src/test-utils.ts
  - packages/memory/src/index.ts
- [x] Updated all usages across codebase
- [x] Updated tests

---

### 12. Remove Unused File
**Issue:** `packages/core/src/types/message-format.ts` seems unnecessary

**File:** `packages/core/src/types/message-format.ts`

**Content:** Defines `MessageFormat` type with values like `'mastra-db'`, `'aiv4-ui'`, etc.

**Questions:**
- [ ] Is this file actually used anywhere?
- [ ] Should MessageList handle format conversions instead?
- [ ] If unused, remove it entirely
- [ ] If used, ensure it's properly integrated and documented
- [ ] Did we add this for convertMessages() util since we now use it inside of toAISdkXMessages() util? Should we just call MessageList directly in our new util? And skip convertMessages()

**Action:**
- [ ] Search for imports of this file
- [ ] If unused, delete it
- [ ] If used, verify it's necessary and not duplicating MessageList functionality

---

### 13. Fix TODO Comment in Tests ✅ COMPLETE
**Issue:** Test comment suggests `saveMessages` returns wrong format

**File:** `packages/memory/integration-tests/src/working-memory.test.ts`

**Status:** ✅ **COMPLETE**
- [x] Investigated - `saveMessages` correctly returns `MastraDBMessage[]` when `format: 'v2'` is specified
- [x] The overload signatures are correct
- [x] Removed the TODO comment
- [x] Tests already verify the return format is correct (checking `m.content.parts` which is MastraDBMessage format)

---

## 🔵 LOW PRIORITY: Verification & Testing

### 14. Verify Downstream MastraDBMessage Usage
**Issue:** Ensure all code that receives `MastraDBMessage` can handle it properly

**File:** `packages/server/src/server/handlers/memory.ts`

**Example:**
```typescript
// Get thread messages for context
const threadMessages = (await memory.query({ threadId: msgThreadId })).messages;
```

**Action:**
- [ ] Trace all usages of `threadMessages` in `searchMemoryHandler`
- [ ] Verify downstream code can handle `MastraDBMessage` format
- [ ] Check if conversion to UI format is needed anywhere
- [ ] Add tests for search functionality with new format
- [ ] Look for other similar code in handlers and verify it works

---

## 📋 Documentation Updates Needed

### 15. Update Migration Guide
**File:** `docs-new/docs/reference/agents/migration-guide.md`

**Action:**
- [ ] Document removal of `format` parameter from get methods
- [ ] Document standardized return type `{ messages: MastraDBMessage[] }`
- [ ] Document removal of `MastraMessageV2` type
- [ ] Document MessageList `.v2()` → `.db()` rename
- [ ] Add examples of new API usage
- [ ] Add examples of using `@mastra/ai-sdk/ui` conversion functions

---

### 16. Update Memory API Docs
**Files:**
- `docs-new/docs/reference/memory/*.md`

**Action:**
- [ ] Update all memory method signatures
- [ ] Update return type examples
- [ ] Update code samples to use new API
- [ ] Ensure consistency with migration guide

---

## 🔍 Investigation Tasks

### 17. Verify Main Merge Changes
**Action:**
- [ ] Review all changes that came from `main` merge
- [ ] Ensure we didn't accidentally revert any `main` improvements
- [ ] Specifically check:
  - RuntimeContext handling
  - Working memory scope logic
  - Any processor changes
  - Storage adapter changes
- we have a draft PR open so we can use GH cli (or just regular git) to diff against main and see what we actually changed

---

### 18. Run Full Test Suite
**Action:**
- [ ] `pnpm test` - ensure all tests pass
- [ ] `pnpm build` - ensure all packages build
- [ ] `pnpm lint` - ensure no lint errors
- [ ] `pnpm format` - ensure code is formatted
- [ ] Test in local React example app
- [ ] Test in local Node.js example
