# Auth/RBAC E2E Testing Progress Log

## Initial Setup - 2026-01-22

PRD created at plans/prd.json with 10 features for implementing WorkOS auth and RBAC E2E tests.

### Features Overview (by priority):
- P0: Infrastructure Setup, Login Flow, Admin Role, Member Role, Viewer Role Tests
- P1: Sign Up Flow, Logout Flow, Unauthorized Access Tests
- P2: Session Expiry, Role Switching Tests

### Role Permissions Being Tested:
- admin: Full access ['*']
- member: agents:read, workflows:*, tools:read, tools:execute
- viewer: agents:read, workflows:read
- _default: No permissions []

### Pre-PRD Fix - 2026-01-22

**Issue**: E2E tests were failing with 403 Forbidden errors even though auth was disabled.

**Root Cause**: The new `requiresPermission` feature on routes (added for RBAC) was enforcing permissions even when no auth provider was configured. Routes like `GET /api/agents` had `requiresPermission: 'agents:read'` set, and when auth was disabled, `userPermissions` was undefined, causing the permission check to fail.

**Fix**: Updated `server-adapters/hono/src/index.ts` to check if auth is configured before enforcing route permissions:
```typescript
// Only enforce permissions when auth is configured
const authConfig = this.mastra.getServer()?.auth;
if (route.requiresPermission && authConfig) {
  // ... permission check
}
```

**Result**: All 25 E2E tests now pass.

## F001: E2E Test Infrastructure Setup - COMPLETED - 2026-01-22

### Implementation Summary

Created the foundational E2E testing infrastructure for auth/RBAC tests using Playwright route interception.

### Files Created

1. **packages/playground/e2e/tests/__utils__/auth.ts**
   - Core auth mocking utilities
   - `setupMockAuth(page, config)` - Main helper for mocking auth state
   - `setupAdminAuth/MemberAuth/ViewerAuth/Unauthenticated/NoPermissions` - Convenience methods
   - `buildAuthCapabilities(config)` - Builds mock `/api/auth/capabilities` responses
   - Role permissions and mock users constants

2. **packages/playground/e2e/tests/__utils__/index.ts**
   - Exports all test utilities for cleaner imports

3. **packages/playground/e2e/tests/auth/infrastructure.spec.ts**
   - 16 infrastructure validation tests
   - Tests auth capabilities mocking for all roles
   - Tests custom user data and permissions
   - Tests disabled RBAC and auth states
   - Tests `/api/auth/me` endpoint mocking

4. **packages/playground/e2e/tests/auth/README.md**
   - Documentation for auth E2E tests
   - Usage examples for auth utilities
   - Test categories and permissions reference

5. **packages/playground/e2e/kitchen-sink/fixtures/auth-roles.fixture.ts**
   - Role permissions matching PRD specification
   - Mock user profiles for each role
   - Permission expectations for validation
   - UI expectations for role-based visibility

6. **packages/playground/e2e/kitchen-sink/.env.example**
   - Environment variable template for WorkOS credentials
   - Documentation for required/optional variables

### Approach

Uses **Playwright route interception** to mock auth endpoints:
- Intercepts `/api/auth/capabilities` to return mock auth state
- Intercepts `/api/auth/me` to return mock user data
- No real WorkOS credentials needed for testing
- Tests are fast and deterministic

### Test Results

- **All 41 E2E tests pass** (25 existing + 16 new auth infrastructure tests)
- Typecheck passes with no errors

### Acceptance Criteria Met

- [x] Auth test directory structure exists at `packages/playground/e2e/tests/auth/`
- [x] Test fixtures can simulate different user roles (admin, member, viewer, _default)
- [x] Kitchen-sink app runs with mocked auth via route interception
- [x] Helper utilities are reusable across all auth tests

---

### Next Steps

Start with F002 (Login Flow E2E Tests) or one of the P0 role tests (F005, F006, F007).
