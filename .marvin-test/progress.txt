## Task 1: Navigation - Clean up breadcrumb navigation (COMPLETED)

### Changes Made:
- Removed 'Chat' button from agent-header.tsx (packages/playground/src/domains/agents/agent-header.tsx)
- Removed the DividerIcon that preceded the Chat button
- The 'Traces' button remains intact and navigates to `/observability?entity=${agentId}`
- Traces button uses Button component from @mastra/playground-ui which follows the design system

### Files Modified:
- packages/playground/src/domains/agents/agent-header.tsx

### Verification:
- TypeScript type checks passed
- The Traces button CSS is inherited from the playground-ui design system Button component

- Changed from fixed height (`h-[54px]`) to minimum height (`min-h-[48px]`) for flexible content
- Added rounded corners (`rounded-md`) for modern appearance
- Added horizontal margin (`mx-1`) and vertical spacing (`my-0.5`) for visual separation
- Changed active state from `bg-accent1Dark` to `bg-surface3` for consistent hover/active styling
- Added vertical padding (`py-1`) to ThreadList container
- Removed `overflow-hidden` from Threads container to allow proper scroll behavior

### Files Modified:
- packages/playground-ui/src/ds/components/Threads/threads.tsx
