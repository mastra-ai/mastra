# Upgrade to Mastra v1

In this guide you'll learn how to upgrade through breaking changes in pre-v1 versions of Mastra. It'll also help you upgrade to Mastra v1.

Use your package manager to update your project's versions. Be sure to update **all** Mastra packages at the same time.

:::info

Versions mentioned in the headings refer to the `@mastra/core` package. If necessary, versions of other Mastra packages are called out in the detailed description.

All Mastra packages have a peer dependency on `@mastra/core` so your package manager can inform you about compatibility.

## Migrate to v0.23 (unreleased)

:::note

This version isn't released yet but we're adding changes as we make them.

### Changed: Thread Title Generation Location and Default

**Breaking Changes:**

1. `generateTitle` has been moved from `threads.generateTitle` to the top-level of memory options
2. The default value has changed from `true` to `false`
3. Using `threads.generateTitle` will now throw an error

**Why these changes?**

- Simplify the API by moving `generateTitle` to the top level where it logically belongs
- Avoid unexpected LLM API calls and associated costs
- Give developers explicit control over when title generation occurs
- Improve predictability of memory behavior

**Migration:**

If your application uses `threads.generateTitle`, you must update it to use the top-level `generateTitle` option:

```typescript
// Before (v0.22 and earlier)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      threads: {
        generateTitle: true, // ❌ This will now throw an error
      },
    },
  }),
});

// After (v0.23+)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      generateTitle: true, // ✅ Now at the top level
    },
  }),
});
```

If your application relied on the old default behavior (automatic title generation), explicitly enable it:

```typescript
// Before (implicit true in v0.22)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    // generateTitle was true by default
  }),
});

// After (explicit true in v0.23+)
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      generateTitle: true, // Explicitly enable title generation
    },
  }),
});
```

You can also customize the model and instructions used for title generation:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: new Memory({
    options: {
      generateTitle: {
        model: openai("gpt-4o-mini"),
        instructions:
          "Generate a concise title (max 5 words) that summarizes the conversation",
      },
    },
  }),
});
```

### Changed: Memory Default Settings

The default settings for semantic recall have been optimized based on RAG research:

- **`topK`** increased from `2` to `4` - Retrieves 4 most relevant messages instead of 2
- **`messageRange`** changed from `{before: 2, after: 2}` to `{before: 1, after: 1}` - Includes 1 message before and after each retrieved message instead of 2

**Impact:**

When semantic recall is enabled, you'll now retrieve up to 12 messages total (4 × 3) instead of 10 messages (2 × 5). This provides ~8% better accuracy while only increasing message count by 20%.

**Action Required:**

If you were relying on the previous defaults and want to maintain the old behavior, explicitly set these values:

```typescript
const agent = new Agent({
  memory: {
    semanticRecall: {
      topK: 2,
      messageRange: { before: 2, after: 2 },
    },
  },
});
```

If you're not using semantic recall (it's disabled by default), no changes are needed.

### Removed: Deprecated APIs

#### Agent Execution Methods

- Removed `generateVNext()` method. Use `generate()` instead.
- Removed `streamVNext()` method. Use `stream()` instead.

#### Agent Default Options Methods

Methods have been renamed to clarify which are for legacy vs current APIs:

- `getDefaultGenerateOptions()` → `getDefaultGenerateOptionsLegacy()`
- `getDefaultStreamOptions()` → `getDefaultStreamOptionsLegacy()`
- `getDefaultVNextStreamOptions()` → `getDefaultStreamOptions()`

#### Output Options

- Removed deprecated `output` field from `generate()`/`stream()` options. Use `structuredOutput.schema` instead:

```typescript
// Before
const result = await agent.generate(messages, {
  output: z.object({
    answer: z.string(),
  }),
});

// After
const result = await agent.generate(messages, {
  structuredOutput: {
    schema: z.object({
      answer: z.string(),
    }),
  },
});
```

#### Abort Signal

- Removed `modelSettings.abortSignal`. Use the top-level `abortSignal` option instead:

```typescript
// Before
const result = await agent.stream(messages, {
  modelSettings: {
    abortSignal: controller.signal,
    temperature: 0.7,
  },
});

// After
const result = await agent.stream(messages, {
  abortSignal: controller.signal,
  modelSettings: {
    temperature: 0.7,
  },
});
```

#### MCP tools

- Removed `elicitation` and `extra` from top level arguments. Use the `mcp` property instead.

```typescript
export const accountBalance = createTool({
  id: "account-balance",
  description: "Fetches the current account balance for a given account",
  inputSchema: z.object({
    accountId: z.string(),
  }),
  outputSchema: z.object({
    balance: z.number(),
  }),
  execute: async ({ context, mcp }) => {
    if (mcp) {
      await checkAuth(mcp.extra.authInfo);

      const result = await mcp.elicitation.sendRequest({
        message: `Is it ok to fetch the account balance for account ${context.accountId}?`,
        requestedSchema: {
          type: "object",
          properties: {
            confirm: { type: "boolean" },
          },
          required: ["confirm"],
        },
      });

      if (result.action === "accept") {
        return {
          balance: getAccountBalance(context.accountId),
        };
      }
    }
  },
});
```

#### Input processors

- Removed the `@mastra/core/agent/input-processors` exports. They can found at `@mastra/core/processors` now.
- `InputProcessor` type removed in favour of `Processor` which implements a `processInput` function.

## Migrate to v0.22

### Changed: Memory Scope Defaults

`@mastra/memory` - `0.16.0`  
`@mastra/core` - `0.22.0`

The default memory scope for both **working memory** and **semantic recall** has changed from `'thread'` to `'resource'`.

**Before:**

- Working memory defaulted to `scope: 'thread'` (isolated per conversation)
- Semantic recall defaulted to `scope: 'thread'` (search within current conversation only)

**After:**

- Working memory defaults to `scope: 'resource'` (persists across all user conversations)
- Semantic recall defaults to `scope: 'resource'` (search across all user conversations)

**Why this change?**

1. **Better user experience**: Most applications want to remember user information across conversations, not just within a single thread
2. **More intuitive default**: Users expect AI agents to "remember" them, which requires resource-scoped memory
3. **Alignment with common use cases**: The majority of production applications use resource-scoped memory

**Migration:**

If you want to maintain the old behavior where memory is isolated per conversation thread, explicitly set `scope: 'thread'` in your memory configuration:

```typescript showLineNumbers copy
import { Memory } from "@mastra/memory";
import { LibSQLStore } from "@mastra/libsql";

const memory = new Memory({
  storage: new LibSQLStore({ url: "file:local.db" }),
  options: {
    workingMemory: {
      enabled: true,
      scope: "thread", // Explicitly set to thread-scoped
      template: `# User Profile
- **Name**: 
- **Interests**: 
`,
    },
    semanticRecall: {
      topK: 3,
      scope: "thread", // Explicitly set to thread-scoped
    },
  },
});
```

If you want to adopt the new default behavior, you can optionally remove explicit `scope: 'resource'` declarations as they're now redundant.

### Deprecated: `format: "aisdk"`

The `format: "aisdk"` option in `stream()`/`generate()` methods is deprecated. Use the `@mastra/ai-sdk` package instead. Learn more in the [Using Vercel AI SDK documentation](../../frameworks/agentic-uis/ai-sdk.md).

### Removed: MCP Classes

`@mastra/mcp` - `0.14.0`

- Removed `MastraMCPClient` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.md) class instead.
- Removed `MCPConfigurationOptions` type. Use [`MCPClientOptions`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.md#mcpclientoptions) type instead. The API is identical.
- Removed `MCPConfiguration` class. Use [`MCPClient`](../../reference/tools/mcp-client.md) class instead.

### Removed: CLI flags & commands

`mastra` - `0.17.0`

- Removed the `mastra deploy` CLI command. Use the deploy instructions of your individual platform.
- Removed `--env` flag from `mastra build` command. To start the build output with a custom env use `mastra start --env <env>` instead.
- Remove `--port` flag from `mastra dev`. Use `server.port` on the `new Mastra()` class instead.

## Migrate to v0.21
