# PR

The user will issue this command. You will need to do the following:

1. Create a changeset in .changeset, ensuring the naming convention for the changeset file is inline with other changesets in the .changeset folder.

- major changes are backward-incompatible
- minor changes add new features while remaining backward-compatible
- patch versions fix bugs with backward-compatible updates.

2. Open a PR using the GitHub CLI

Add a descriptive/concise title, use conventional commits in the title (eg "fix: title here")

Add a concise, humble PR description without flowery or overly verbose language.
Keep it casual/friendly but get to the point. Show simple code examples before/after for fixes, or just after examples for new features.
Do not add lists or headings. Keep it simple and to the point
