# Create New Pull Request

Use gh cli to open a PR for the current branch in the user's browser. Do not open it directly, use the web option that opens it in the browser so the user can edit the title/description if needed.

Add a descriptive/concise title, use conventional commits in the title (eg "fix: title here")

Add a concise, humble PR description without flowery or overly verbose language.
Keep it casual/friendly but get to the point. Show simple code examples before/after for fixes, or just after examples for new features.
Do not add lists or headings. Keep it simple and to the point
